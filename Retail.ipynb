              "'Purchased on Black FridayPros - Great Price (even off sale)Very powerful and fast with quad core processors Amazing soundWell builtCons -Amazon ads, Amazon need this to subsidize the tablet and will remove the adds if you pay them $15.Inability to access other apps except the ones from Amazon. There is a way which I was able to accomplish to add the Google Play storeNet this is a great tablet for the money I purchased two Amazon in Echo Plus and two dots plus four fire sticks and the hub Philips hue for lamp for the family at Christmas 2017. I‚Äôm so happy with these purchases and learning so much with Alexa. You can start your daily routine with Alexa and program it to whatever you would like to include news weather music horoscope ALSO you can start your day off with a compliment and I think is very important. Alexa gave me the BEST CHILI RECIPE I MEAN THE BEST it‚Äôs called Chili I. I want my husband to use Alexa to stay organized for business dates and reminders. This is the way to go very good product. Exactly what I wanted, and a very good price This is the 3rd one I\\'ve purchased. I\\'ve bought one for all of my nieces. No other case compares to this one. It has held protected the tablet so many times from them dropping it. This is a great product. Light weight. I wish it has wifi to download from online. Purchased this for my son. Has room to upgrade memory to allow more books & games. But the speakers could be better or located in a better position. Bought this for my mom and it was just what she needed and at a great price. Been wanting to get an Ipad for myself, but think this might be a great less expensive option for me as well. I got this tablet to replace my sons old one, I love the adult/child profile and the ability to have the 2 year replacement warranty. The case has also came in handy many times. Great product for the kids gaming apps parental controls to make sure you can monitor kids and prevent unwanted app purchases Love the choice of colors. Have two kindles of my own and purchased this for a gift. It replaces my 6\" Fire Kindle. Love the HD quality. We bought this to replace my children\\'s aging Ipads and they\\'re very happy. This was a great purchase! Love the fact I can download TV or movies and watch off-line. Easy set up. Surprisingly useful. Ben 2 Echo is much better than Gen 1. Definitely recommend. Got this model only because of the sale price and the built in hub that controls my hue strip lights. And....I didn‚Äôt want to say google all the time! Sounds like baby talk to me....lol I was a little hesitant to spend the money to get this but I am so glad I did! Alexa always answers when I say the commands and I have noticed it is probably 95% right with any command that I have given. Love the fact that I can see things on the screen. Some of my news briefings have a picture/video so that\\'s nice too. We also love the video call option. Planning on getting one for my grandma who is not as technologically advanced, and could just sit at a table and talk with the grandkids. Worth every penny. Alexa Exceed expectations in it ability to control Great tablet for the grandkids, they love it great item For those that have Prime this is almost a must have. Keeps all your Amazon stuff in one place. it is small enough to carry in your purse and open up a whole new world while waiting at appointments. If you want to listen to music you will have to sign for Amazon unlimited or Prime which is very expensive. Pandora does not work too well with this device as it does with Google Home. This was a gift for mom. She enjoys that it\\'s easy to use and has good picture and sound quality. The price was also great This kindle has easier viewing and the light adjustment is great. Wanted a tablet that would fit in my purse. Very easy to use. Would buy again. Grand kids love it and it picked up the network in short order. They like the idea they have an iPad like the adults. Well implemented. Good but setup to enable voice control only on iOS is unclear. We are new to connected home equipment. I got this for my wife in our kitchen. The only thing I wish was different would be that the Amazon Show would communicate directly with FaceTime rather than having to have someone download the Alexa app. Not a deal breaker by any means though. We love it I use it alot to play music instead of running the tv for my dog when we go somewhere. I use it for a lot of things. Easy to set up, easy to use apps are awesome and sounds great! This is a great tablet for basic needs.. internet.. video streaming.. games.. books... you dont need an ipad?.. get one of these. I like this tablet. It has everything you want. However the apps within it need to be updated more often. If this happened than it would be top above an iPad mini. For now, it gives me enough of what I need and in HD. For $89 it was a good deal. Worked better than expected! Highly recommend the Echo Show Great sound quality. Easy to set up. Easy to use. Looks good too. This tablet is quick and as good as my iPad! I use the tablet specifically for one aspect of my life and it performs great! I am pleasantly surprised by its performance! Amazon\\'s Echo Show has been a great help to my daily rutine. From asking simple things like the weather to more specific things like flash briefings or traffic to my commute, echo show is a great tool for any tech enthusiast Has meet all my needs plus some. Recommend you buy a good stylus pen at the same time. This is a great tablet. It has amazing storage. I use mine daily. Great for reading, surfing the web and games. The one small thing I don\\'t like is Amazon prime shows are a bit dark for some reason. Hulu and Netflix work wonderful. It\\'s a good tablet and comes with a lot of free apps and a fantastic warranty! I use it in my office as a personal assistant. Not just for the home Tech is not totally friendly but for The cost and what it does it is worth the investment The Tap is essentially a smaller version of the Echo that has Alexa capability like Echo does, but also doubles as a portable Bluetooth speaker. You do need to tap it to ask Alexa to do anything, but otherwise it works the same as Echo. I prefer the Echo, but the Tap is great for college students and those who just want to supplement their Echo. Awesome product. DoEs what it says and looks great I bought this device to use with children in my therapy practice. It is taking me awhile to figure out how to set it up and organize it. IT \\'took over\\' and set up things with Amazon I did not approve such as charging my account and registering me with Prime before I could figure out the settings. The picture quality for the screen is beautiful but the camera photos are very pixelated. Inexpensive tablet for him to use and learn on, step up from the NABI. He was thrilled with it, learn how to Skype on it already... Our 3rd Amazon fire. The battery life is outstanding. Really nice when reading a book not having to worry about the battery. Nice size. at first I wasnt sure if this was something I \"needed\" when I already have the echo but it was on sale for black friday so I thought why not. As soon as it was set up I understood why I \"needed\" this. It just enhances everything Alexa does! Being able to see what she says is great! Seeing and adjusting my shopping list by touch is amazing. I love walking in the room and seeing little news blurbs. It looks sleek and beautiful on my counter. I highly recommend this to anyone. I bought this for my wife as a gift to replace her older fire. Absolutely loves it. Has all of the features she needs. I don\\'t think there is a better tablet on the market and the value is incredible. Love having this in my kitchen. Play music, ask questions, make list, set timers, etc. It\\'s at its heart an echo, but having a screen on it, with 1000s of things to do with it make it a much easier recommendation over the simarly priced screenless echo plus Works well. Easy to use. I like the auto on when you open the case Great entertainment when friends are over. The knowledge and jokes are tons of fun. Definitely an amazing deal at an amazing price on Black Friday weekend This little sorcerer\\'s box displays magical pictures and bright pretty colors. The kindle fire kid is easy enough that our 2 year old can work it!!! If you use the Alexa ecosystem then the show is a must. The commercials are correct, at this price you can have multiple devices in your household for the price of a comparable competitor\\'s tablet. I have not set up tablet, geeks squad to do so Monday April 3 2017 If you like video this goes along perfect ...a must buy I\\'ve had the first kindle fire, I love the tablet.Why because it\\'s bigger This was a good pick for first kids tablets. I just wish getting to their apps was a little easier i was weary about it at first but it was easy to setup and get the hang of and definitely makes life easier! This was a gift for a family member they really enjoy all the options of getting books Alexa works pretty good, music sounds good. Just exploring all her skills I love my Echo Tap! I have my own personal alarm, informs me on today\\'s weather forcast and local events. Great purchase. Pretty decent tablet. Good for mindless games and Netflix. You get what you pay for. I really enjoy having another way to communicate with family and friends I use this all the time for playing games and reading books, it\\'s great for surfing the web too. The echo show is a great accessory to any house . It has a great picture on it and great sound . It‚Äôs simple to use . My wife uses it for recipes when cooking and making grocery lists . Also listens to music with crisp sound. Can ask Alexa pretty much anything . Since I purchased mine the wife thought she would also like one so we picked up her one and she is using it a lot. My son washed it twice! Throw it a few times and it\\'s still ticking. My home is about 80% automated with help from ALEXA...We want to have one in each room. Its a great ereader but a little pricy. It has the same specs as the Voyage as far as pixels and procesor, which costs less. The only difference between this and the Voyage, is that it\\'s much lighter, it\\'s brighter (LEDs), and a longer battery life if you\\'re using the cover. I\\'ve noticed the battery life drains much faster without the cover, but you\\'ll still be able to read for hours without it. You would think it be water resistant, hence the name but it isn\\'t. But then I don\\'t plan on reading when it\\'s raining or outside or while taking a bath. Overall, it\\'s the best ereader Amazon currently has to offer but if you don\\'t mind the price tag and want the best, then go for it! Voyage is still not a bad option though Both love this tablet and the numerous educational apps available that I bought one for each Bought it for my 10 yr old granddaughter. Does everything she wants it to do in a tablet. I was unable to find a new Kindle in-store and was excited to find Best Buy had them online and I could purchase it and have it delivered simply and easily. It\\'s great but I miss the hd option. My 5yo loves it! I can read books, listen to books, go on facebook, shop, search the web almost anything on my brand new Kindle Fire!! Great tablet for simple tasks. I bought 2 and I have no complaints. Purchase was to replace Fire HD 8.9 that was left on a plane (found & return 50 days later). Like this smaller version due to size & it\\'s 3 years newer on the technology side. Love the echo show so much! Easy to use, connects to your mobil phone to easily call people! I chose this one because of the price and size of screen to use as an ereader. It has not disappointed. I bought this for my 86 year old father. he loves it. finds it very easy to use Still learning and figuring out all it can do for me! Everything is great except that i can\\'t read external pdfs properly. Either it zooms too much of too little. For kindle books it provides great experience. Battery life is awesome! Easy to install, very easy to use, we enjoy the product and learn more about it all the time Good product and the quality of the product is good. Easy to use. Its worth every penny. The kids loved it our home is quieter then ever. Great for looking up recipes when your cooking and your hands are tied up. Also, perfect for ‚Äúdropping in‚Äù on family & friends. Love the tap. The speaker is nice. Likenit has a charging cradle it can sit on. Easy charge. I would highly recommend this kindle. It is user friendly and not to big. But large enough to see easily Is great for my son 8 years old, they help with homework The table is great just to experience what is available on a tablet without a hugh expense. I would recommend to others. Gift for daughter. She loves it. Just opened so as far as I know it will be a great purchase. I love to buy stuff at best buy Most of the employees are great at helping With everything i needEspecially JISSELA Love the choice of colors. Have two kindles of my own and purchased this for a gift. Overall works well. Sound better than dot. Screen is clear. It was easy to set up and use. Best Buy employees were a huge help teaching me about the many features. I love the Echo Show and its many features, great purchase. My 9 year old loves it. Good control options. Just need to figure out how to get the Web browser on her side. When you first turn on the kindle, the home screen does not make it easy to determine exactly how to open up and read a downloaded book. I have really enjoyed it so far. While not perfect by any means it is certainly worth the price. My fianc√©e really enjoyes it! I would definitely recommend. excellent screen, the small changes to the form make a huge different (I adore the flatness so much), and the brightness is a perfect for daylight. IMO, worth the cost When I purchased the Tap I thought it was a portable speaker for the echo. It\\'s actually it\\'s own device. Yes, it\\'s portable, can operate wireless.It does work with the same \"alexa\" set up. The Echo operates with no hands‚Ä¶you can simply speak to Alexa. The tap has a microphone button you need to hold down to speak to Alexa. Great sound quality. Rechargeable base unit. these tablets work wonders for my needs, i didnt need a tablet to work, only for web browsing and play some games. nothing fancy, this tablet fits perfectly for that. and the price...pff perfect. ! you wont find this quality cheaper. Excellent value for my 3 yr old, everything you need plus HD and the wife can order off amazon prime, so happy wife and kid for the price cant beat it, 2nd one I have owned.... Has all the functionality a child needs with easy parental controls. Like the child profile with only approved content. Needed a tablet for games and apps for the elderly. Great choice Bought for Xmass for my wife. She is not electronic competent, but found is easy to use. We are so pleased with this tablet. We purchased one for each of our grandsons. They can all use them, play games together and send messages to the grandparents once in awhile. This one is the best...I have the dots but this is so nice if you have cameras just ask for that camera and you will get it on the screen.. spend the extra .. Last Christmas I gave my nephew a fire stick, which he loved. In the meantime, I purchased an Amazon Tap for myself. Since he likes gadgets, I knew he would want one. So I purchased it for him Let there be light - this has been awesome to be able to walk in to a room and with a spoken word from me have the light go on. Equally impressive is that it gradually goes bright so you aren‚Äôt blinded by it. This feels like an affordable tablet. While not the best in class, it isn\\'t priced to be that either. Works well. Happy with purchase. bought this kindle for my grandson, he loves it and it very easy to use this item work just as I expected it to, great product! My daughter loves it. Parental controls are simple makes it easy when monitoring what my kid is in to Got this for my Dad for Christmas. Awesome gift, he was super excited!! My husband loves the ability to listen to anything and to be able to run the living room light when he comes in instead of trying to find the light switch. Nice tablet and very fast/capable. The storage options are way better than the previous models. I would highly recommend this tablet to anyone in the market for one. I bought this for my kids its a cheap alternative to an Ipad mini and should they lose it or break it its easy to replace with little out of pocket. Got this for my dad for Christmas. He likes that the speakers sound better. He also enjoys being able to make video calls with it. I love this kindle works great for me I will be ordering another one today for my wife. Will definitely keep buying Kindle fire from Best buy This 8\" tablet is much better than the older 7\" tablet. It is faster and have a camera. Great improvement over the older version. We love the echo show. Best feature is the flash bringing that gives us a rundown on news and weather each morning. I find myself saying to my phone, \"Alexa, play.........\". I wish they made it for my car too. My 2 1/2 year old loves this. He can\\'t break it with the thick rubber case, and we can control the games he plays, and how long he plays. Great mix of educational and fun items. The only problem is the charging cord is a bit too easy to break. If they pull it off the charger, it makes the port loose and you have to get the right angle for it to charge. Great item, we love our Echo. If only she could mow the yard for the kids.... Fun gadget. Plays songs, various entertainment, still learning all it can do I was really reluctant buying Alexa but I‚Äôve read so much about this item that I bought the package (Alexa and Phillips bulb) and have been amazed with how well it works. The Echo show is addictive. Pairs easy, fantastic sound and video and once you download the Alexa app and learn a few things it becomes indispensable. Video calls work well. Great for the office or Kitchen. My kid enjoys the tablet. This one is inexpensive than ipad. The availability of apps are limited. I bought this tablet for my three year old niece. It was easy to set up for her, and she loves it. I also purchased the Kids Free case, to protect it. Tablet works will with Amazon video on our smart tvs as well as the firesticks. This is just perfect for my 7 year old nothing fancy, parental control is a bit confusing but i got it now, the case is perfect to keep it.safe just get a sd card for extra memory I never owned a Kindle before. This was easy to setup and get going.It also looks really good. The text is super easy to read even at smaller fonts. I also really like the buttons on the side that turn the pages because it is a lot easier to flip pages compared to tapping the screen. I used to watch youtube on my phone and wife decided I needed something bigger. I seem to like it very much. I did buy a micro sd card for it. Bought this for our 7 and 5 year old. They love to play music and ask questions about science. Lots of fun! The Echo Plus is an Awesome Device. Lots of information just by speech. My granddaughter is very happy great for kids to learn , reading help Great tablet for ages 8 and under my kids love them Love that I could get it in a color! And it\\'s just the right size for little hands. Used it for learning apps for my 3 yo other than the fact that she put it in the dryer (while I was throwing clothes in there) and completely broke it, it works wonders. It\\'s the 2nd one I\\'ve bought. Bought this as a gift for my 3 year old granddaughter. She is learning how to get to her apps and play some games on it. I like that I can have contol over what she can watch and play. works great for us for video calling, for kids watching videos We bought the fire for my 85 yr old aunt. She loves it!! Easy to use I like the ease and usage of the amazon show. I have a amazon echo and I decided to upgrade to this for the video call. Overall great product! Had problem with cutting off device. Good easy read I like the contrast it is easy to read on outside. Alexa is the greatest device to have around the house. She basically runs my house for me I love this e-reader. My other reader was not backlit so needed something I could use in low light. This works perfectly for reading at night and in the sun. The light is adjustable. Love downloading books from the library. It has a 3G connection which I have not used yet, so far used only in wi-fi areas. Nice way to see the internet and also to view security cameras. Very handy device. I am an avid Amazon user for shopping and tablets, I bought a different model for my younger brother and now purchased this one for my grandparents and they love it! When you can get this thing on sale it\\'s an amazing deal. Have all of your Amazon features right in your face. Books, Manga, Gaming, Amazon. It\\'s easy to hold, has amazing battery life and has a pretty decent screen. Sure the Galaxy tablets have better specs, but it\\'s the price and features you get from Amazon that make this device amazing! I recommend this tablet !!! I like it a lot , perfect size and perfect price The tablet was a good gift for Christmas. I bought it on black Friday for a cheap price My 2 years old daughter really likes it. It\\'s friendly and easy to use. My wife and I enjoy using Alexa for weather information and also for the great music that we are able to access. We also have the light under the control of Alexa so that we never have to walk into a dark house again. Bought this charger for the Kindle voyage and its great. So far the Echo has been extreme useful. My husband just says start my day in the morning and it gives him the weather and traffic before he leaves for work. It is also is nice to tell it to turn on and off lights in the home with the smart bulbs. Overall I\\'m extremely satisfied with my Echo plus. Gift for my mom and she had no problem learning to use. Works great !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Purchased this for a gift for my mother who is a amazon fanatic she loves it ! Made her christmas this year Got one for my daughter last year and she loves it. Love this product, able to read recipes instead of just hearing them. Speaker is pretty good too. My children think these are the greatest. I\\'m kind of partial to agree. You can limit their time, access and the things are built like a tank. You can\\'t do better for$60. My only concerns is the battery life could be a bit better and it has a cheap plastic feel to it. Great for light browsing and Kindle reading though. Purchased for my 3 year old grand daughter, she LOVES it. This product was purchased for my son to use with another product that required this particular tablet. I think compared to other brands we have or have had this one is pretty good, easy to operate, and I like that the parent has to approve of the settings and games/activity for the child to use. I would however like to see this product allow google accounts to hook up with it so that way you can get stuff from google play on it that amazon store doesn\\'t have! This is the best kindle ereader yet. The size and weight make it perfect for comfortable reading. You will find yourself reading more books than ever with it. Friend received Amazon Echo as gift & is enjoying it. I researched & decided on Echo Plus as I wanted capability to use to control home lighting. Absolutely love this product! It controls lights in several rooms as well as outdoor lighting. Other features, weather, news briefs, traffic are fun, but the lighting control did it for me. Very competitive Price - Unit works well we like color and size Echo Plus is everything I expected and more. Plus easy to set up. Alexa is a great product that can perform tasks and answer all kinds of questions. The Show and its video feature makes it that much more interactive. Love how user friendly the Kindle Fire is, for any age.. This is my 3rd Kindle upgrade. I love everything about it. The ebooks read to me at night, the games and the movies show extremely well...feels as though I am right there. My kids have ipads...but I\\'m stuck on my Kindle. Amazon free time great for small kids to get entertained I hope to find all my books in the electronic format. The Alexa show is a great product and the price was even better I bought this as a present for a friend, and he uses it all the time. The HD screen is crystal clear, and this tablet competes well with the bigger names. I have had several variations of the Kindle in the past. My most recent being a paperwhite. I have to say this is the best. The size and balance are better. The adaptable light feature and brightness is good. Screen quality and construction are both an improvement. The overall reading experience is much improved over the paperwhite. This is really good if you read a lot, doesn\\'t strain your eyes and very light weight. Only demerit is - cant use in night if there is not enough light. This purchase is replacing an echo for that is being moved to a bedroom. The sound is far superior to the dot (which has decent sound). The echos just keep getting better and more useful. Works as expected. Very easy to use and does not hurt my eyes like a tablet would. Perfect for teenage tablet, perfect for homework!! Just writing this review to get my points...This was a gift for my mother. I think she likes it fine. This is my third Kindle Fire and it improves each time. Colors are crisper and best of all it stays charged a lot longer. Purchased for a family member. They love it. Would Recommend. I really was looking for a simple, cheap tablet to play games and mess around on. Screen is really nice and it serves it\\'s purpose well. Video and games both work really well on them. The only real negative about the tablet is that the cameras are not good. I really don\\'t need them so I don\\'t use them and it\\'s not a big deal for me. Wife loves her Alexa. Uses it with her pandora and the kids love talking to it. Works great! Now if my dogs would actually answer when I call it would be even better! They‚Äôre just not interested but at least I can see what they‚Äôre doing Love the screen and being able to see video along with my cameras on my Vivint smart home The Amazon tap I like other then I wish you could just say her name and she would respond. Sounds great when playing music I bought for the wife for a Christmas present to replace her old Barnes and Noble nook . She loves it , its lighter,faster and has a lot of newer apps on it . great cheap reader. I bought this for my mom. She enjoys checking her email and Facebook. She enjoys playing games most of all. This product is easy to use. Screen size is great. Would recommend to anyone. The bundle will help to test Philips hue light. Purchased additional tplink plug. I personally like the old shape ( more square ) of the kindle better. I use to have a 8 inch and loved it until my grandkids dropped it and now it doesn\\'t work any more. I liked my really old one a bit better. It broke after 5 years suddenly. The screen failed. I had to pay over 20 bucks extra to get rid of the ads to Amazon. I wasn\\'t aware of this when I first bought so it was more expensive than expected. Everybody enjoys this product. We use it to show each other things from my home to my daughters in Melbourne, Florida, keep a running shopping list that can be seen just by asking, and for both verbal and visual reminders of events. I gave as a gift to a kid who has autism! It has been helping on his development a lot! I love my kindle fire it holds a library of books that I can read anywhere. I change from my kindle fire to my phone if I don\\'t have the kindle with me. So I can start right where I am in the book and then finish up on my kindle fire when I can. I play games and listen to books all on this device. Love it Allows me to watch and read digitally. Great product Bought this to use on my travels. comes in handy surfing the web. I purchased this when my last tablet died. It meets all basic needs and the price was great. Love this new Echo Show.The best in the Alexa family I bought this for my daughter who uses it in her AP classes...easier to use a bigger screen than her phone screen in class. She loves it!Price was great! My grand daughter loves it and so do her parents! Very durable. I\\'d highly recommend this product Love device wrong color. Overall great device for Family. I purchased it for my dad (70)He needed something easy to use. He really enjoys it. The kindle fire hd is a sweet tablet for reading and apps like netflix or hulu. This was purchased as a Christmas gift for my wife so I haven\\'t used it yet. We do have several echo dots and we love those. With it coming with hue light bulb that\\'s an added bonus Great kids tablet, we have 4 of them now and they come in handy on long road trips. For the price they are a great buy. I was hesitant on purchasing this new echo but I\\'m glad I did. I really like having the feedback on the screen and seeing results in addition to the voice. Using it for weather, recipes and anything that can be displayed is a big help. The echo show responds fairly fast and looks great in my kitchen counter. A definite winner on this one. I\\'m an author and frequently give these away as promotional prizes. My readers love them. Tablet has worked without a hitch. We bought it for my father, who is just shy of 80. With a couple of instructions, he\\'s been using it without further assistance. Excellent product,my children love this item. Thanks Plays any music you request, answers questions, even tells jokes to my 10 yr old. Much more capability than we\\'ve unleashed yet! The store representative took his time with me to choose the right size and the lady at the check out got me hooked up with Best Buy Program membership. Purchased for son for xmas after experiencing the one at my other sons home. Got this on sale for 69, decent display but you can tell it is not on par with other tablets. It is great if you have prime and use their services. Great speakes, makes a huge difference in Audio quality. Battert life is good, no complaints. I gave it 4 stars due to the play store access. There is a way around it, I do have it on here now but it took some work. We love our Echo plus. Alexa is my go to girl for everything. Music sounds great in the kitchen. Amazon and Philips Hue work great together. very easy setup. The only drawback is using these bulbs on a non-Philips dimmer switch. The bulbs flicker a bit, even when it\\'s set to full on Good price works great would buy again good value for the price We love the new Echo! So easy to set up and use!!! Easy to figure out and I like the paperwhite because it doesn‚Äôt strain your eyes and you can adjust the size of the font. Bought one for my mom too and she loves it. The only con is the touch sensitivity could be better, but not bad for $60 on sale Purchased Alexa Echo Plus instead of bridge for smart home. Alexa is great!! Smart home setup was easy. Bought this for my daughter for Christmas. She absolutely loves it! She has been on it since she opened it. Smaller overall size with the same screen size of our older kindle fire. Faster processor. Great tablet. Easy to use. Will recommend it to others. So easy to use super clear can\\'t. Beat the price all around great buy I bought this to read books on. Excellent for that. Difficult to navigate otherwise Tablets are best used for personal reading. Clear and it like a book. you dont have to sahre Great tablet just what my wife wanted, loves the wifi, much better than her old one. Great easy tablet for a reasonable price. Not the most super powerful. It can get the job done for simple tasks such as surfing the web, checking email, playing YouTube, etc. screen is clear and responsive. Great inexpensive tablet Replaced a Nook with the fire tablet. Disappointed that I cannot use Chromecast from it. Did not realize I would be tied to amazon. But it is a good tablet so far Easy to use. A useful source for kids activity while on the road load up movies books and games! Cheap product but great use good education for ur kids too I loved my echo so much I bought my sister one. I can now turn on my lights when I get home just by asking Alexa. I bought it for my 15 year old daughter and she loves it. Her friends even loved it so much they went and bought them too. Bought this for a 2 year old. She loves it! She\\'s already got more things figured out on it than I do!. Good educational programs and some fun ones too! Great sounding Bluetooth speaker. With the Alexa feature I listen to Kindle books that are not available as audio books This is a great tablet for children and really has an easy to use format. The apps work well and keep the kid entertained by not distracting them with the mechanics. We are used to iPads in our house. This has taken some learning to get used to a slightly different format, but it works great!! The price point is perfect for kids to use without the worry. The only thing that I don\\'t like about it is that the screen is not made to be seen in the sunlight. If I wanted to take it to the beach or poolside to read, I would not be able to see it in the sunlight. Otherwise it is terrific! I would be happy to give it as Christmas gifts to many of the people I know. I love the size of the screen. A charge last and the Bluetooth sinks well with the wireless keyboard. It\\'s almost as good as I IPad. My 5 and 8 year olds love these tablets. They are able to play age appropriate content. Tablet seems well powered and the case is providing good protection. Got this for my 10 year old son. Great for reading books and playing games. Can\\'t beat the price. Does exactly what we wanted it to do. Very easy voice commands. Do you like to read? If so this is an excellent device. There are better devices, but at this price you are not going to find a comparable product. My kids love their kindles and love free time in it. Numerous educational games! I bought this as an affordable alternative to the iPad mini. I liked the expandable storage option and size. Super easy to use. Unfortunately granddaughter wanted and iPad mini to go with her other apple products. So I ended up returning it. In hindsight I should\\'ve kept it for myself. Hard to review as I purchased for my son as a present Great for the child. Unfortunately it doesn\\'t have a volume limit setting My sister told me about the Kindle Fire and I wanted one so she said she bought hers from Best Buy. This is really very comfortable and easy as well as strong for toddler my baby really enjoy using this amazon fire kids Excellent pick up during the Black Friday Sales. Not too big not to small. This tablet bundled up with Amazon Prime service is a great combo of inexpensive entertainment. I‚Äôve had Amazon Alexa since she first hit the streets over two years ago and Echo Show is awesome! It can do so much more than Alexa and Echo Dot! You will love it! Great for my mom who isn\\'t tech savvy. Luv it! :-) Perfect cheap device for kids and grandkids nice to have sitting around Does a lot more than old tablet.It Hasmore memory. Everything I needed it for. Screen is nice enough and price was right. Was looking around for a good cheap tablet and this was the best one I could find especially because Best Buy was having a sale so with the Fire, a case, a stylus and a MicroSD card I only spent a little over a $100. I\\'ve been using it just about every day since I got it in December and I\\'ve not had any problems with it at all Its a great ereader but a little pricy. It has the same specs as the Voyage as far as pixels and procesor, which costs less. The only difference between this and the Voyage, is that it\\'s much lighter, it\\'s brighter (LEDs), and a longer battery life if you\\'re using the cover. I\\'ve noticed the battery life drains much faster without the cover, but you\\'ll still be able to read for hours without it. You would think it be water resistant, hence the name but it isn\\'t. But then I don\\'t plan on reading when it\\'s raining or outside or while taking a bath. Overall, it\\'s the best ereader Amazon currently has to offer but if you don\\'t mind the price tag and want the best, then go for it! Voyage is still not a bad option though This is well constructed for kids. My biggest reason I don\\'t like it is it asks for a credit card, for a kids tablet. I suggest you buy a prepaid credit card or a Amazon gift card for game purchases! great kid friendly product, hours of enjoyment for all. We got this tablet for our toddler. The setup was going great. Installed all the apps from Amazon and transferred them to his account. Then we went to load Netflix for him. To say it\\'s been frustrating with the Netflix app is an understatement. We had to completely reset the tablet to factory settings twice. Netflix does not work well with this tablet. It either takes too long to load and times out or will not load at all. It takes several attempts to get Netflix to load but then it works. That\\'s the only complaint. Other then that it\\'s great. I talk myself into the 32g and I am so glad I did!!! I have used only kindles for the past 5 years and I love them.... I love the color as well!!! This is all around a great tablet. My 1yr old can use it with ease. Also love how we can change the profiles to suit adults as well. Would recommend to anyone and all ages. It is amazing that you can get this much tech for such a low price. This thing does everything I need, and it\\'s so much faster than my old Kindle. Easy to use!! Purchased for my nephew, he\\'s 4, he loves it. Good product for a young child to play with without breaking This was a gift for my grandson and he loves it. It is easy to use and keeps him occupied for hours. Bought it for my daughter and she loves it great product at a great price! So having Alexa on hand could be good and bad. It\\'s nice when I\\'m cooking and I need help with a recipe but it can be annoying when my kids fight over what they want Alexa to answer. Over all it\\'s a nice product, connects to my Ring doorbell too which is nice. Great gifts! I have the Alexa dot in each room now this is better, with the speaker base, ask Alexa to play music, find me recipes, read the news. Got this & few other dot devices to give for Xmas Husband loves the 8\" tablet. The screen is big enough to view what he is reading bought this as a christmas gift for our son, it holds a lot of games and is very easy to use We love our echo show, It‚Äôs fun to use and she can do a lot of things. Bought for the grandkids and they work great might get one for myself I bought the first edition kindle fire years ago. My kids loved it so much that I bought this product to replace the old one. They love this one even more. Larger screen and more memory, you can\\'t go wrong! Alexa works great and does lots of things for you. Fun for the family. The screen really does add tremendous value. The bugs are almost all worked out and the quality of hearing my commands is night and day from a month ago. Dreams need topics, song lyrics scroll during song play, watch movies/trailers and etc. With it, if you can get it on sale, bought my for special deal at Best Buy for $129.99. not sure if the value is there at the regular price of$249.99. but it is very cool device. We\\'re in our 70s and and have a good time with it. Even when I‚Äôm outside in bright sunlight, the words of the book I‚Äôm reading are still crystal clear. That alone makes the Kindle Oasis worth what it cost me.The Kindle Oasis wakes up in just seconds, and any book I choose instantly opens, ready to be read.It is the perfect size and isn‚Äôt heavy or bulky. I really do read for hours at a time. Sometimes I pace the floor while I read. Sometimes I‚Äôm on my elliptical machine when I read. And sometimes I‚Äôm sitting down. No matter what I‚Äôm doing, the Kindle Oasis remains comfortable to hold, and it is always easy on my eyes.When I receive a book that is in PDF, most of the time I can enlarge the words. If it won‚Äôt allow me to enlarge the words, I can change the orientation of the page and the words are automatically larger. I am able to make notes on the book if needed, and I can highlight words and/or passages.My merlot leather cover is attractive. When I flip it open, it is just like opening the cover of a book.How to Make the Battery LastOn the Kindle Oasis page, it says that its ‚Äúdual-battery charging system delivers months of battery life.‚Äù This was a huge thing for me. Instead of having to charge my tablet almost every day, I would be able to read for months without charging the Kindle!Is this how my Oasis has performed? Well, not so much. There are conditions that have to be met for the charge on your Oasis to last for two months.First, you have to limit your reading to thirty minutes a day. That one is impossible for me. There are days that I am only able to read for thirty minutes, but they don‚Äôt occur very often. My Kindle goes everywhere with me, and I use just about every spare moment to read.Second, the wireless needs to be turned off. That one is easy to do but not always easy to remember. The only time the wireless needs to be on is to download one or more books.Third, this is based on your light setting at 10. That is way too low for me. I keep my light setting anywhere from 16 to 18.I don‚Äôt limit my reading to thirty minutes a day, and I try to remember to keep my wireless turned off. My light setting is kept anywhere from 16 to 18, and I put my Kindle to sleep the second I‚Äôm done reading. So how long does a single charge last me? Ten days is the longest a charge has lasted me so far, but it would have kept a charge for several more days if I had remembered to turn my wireless off. Once I succeed in keeping my wireless off, I will let you know how long the charge lasts.Now, I don‚Äôt plug it in to charge as soon as the charge on the cover gets low. I allow my cover charge to go as low as it will possibly go and then the Kindle battery will start to drain since it can no longer charge from the cover. I allow it to drain down to about 50% before I plug the cover and Kindle into my computer to charge.The one thing that surprised me was that everything on the Oasis is in black and white. For some reason, I thought that maybe the book covers would appear in color. But since I bought the Oasis to read books on, color isn‚Äôt needed.Special offers do appear on my screen but only when my Kindle is going to sleep or waking up. They aren‚Äôt a distraction, and to be honest, they are kind of fun to look at. You can pay a higher price so they won‚Äôt appear on your Kindle if you would rather not see them.I asked myself some questions once I had my Kindle and knew just how it worked. If I had known before I bought my Kindle Oasis that the charge wouldn‚Äôt last for months, would I still have bought it? Yes, I would have. If I had known that everything would appear in black and white, would I still have bought it? Yes, I would have. Love my new Kindle Fire - easy to use - the battery life is amazing!! Bought this for my 5 yr old grandson. Great buy for the price. He loves his new tablet. Kindle Fire HD8 is great! Love the the size and the graphics. Easy to use and navigate. Perfect gift for mom! It does what I need it to do, but a few to many apps that are not needed. The Echo Plus is great. ‚ÄúAlexa‚Äù is the best feature. The only problem is, you can‚Äôt use it wirelessly. It must remain plugged in at all times, which is kind of annoying. Bought two as gift to kids. They love it very much Really like the Kindle. The screen is very easy on the eyes, much better for reading than my Ipad!. I am thrilled with this purchase! Both affordable and high quality! 9the screen doesn\\'t show as much as I thought it would but it works great and the speaker seems good on it. Got this for my grand niece, she loves it. Can\\'t beat it for the price. Purchased this for my nephew. He loved it and can\\'t stop playing with it. Amazon Tap pretty much works as advertised, and understand that the product will evolve with system updates. Love how the weather, traffic, movies and sports scores/schedules are answered quickly and effortlessly. This was an excellent gift as I gave it to both my son and daughter and my son, unknowingly gave we a Tap back as well. Can\\'t wait to see what improvements are made with the updates coming This was out first time using any of Amazons alexa products and we love it. So far we have the hue light bulbs and fire stick but plan on updating the front door lock and thermostat. So easy to use and convenient. It was a good gift for the price and had many features and options I like it. It\\'s better than the Apple mini. Plenty of apps. Everyone should have this product. It‚Äôs great to have when you are needing to see something and your hands are full or you can‚Äôt find your phone. Great Echo!! Friend really liked it!! It really does what he wants it to do and he connected his lights to the device. Everything works well. Can\\'t live without this, use for email, banking, social media, reading, watching movies, tv shows, online college courses. Even prints to wireless printer. Good product I would recommend it to everyone thank you if you use it for certain things it\\'s great. Can find most everything on it. Only a few things that can\\'t be downloaded or found in the appstore Amazon MayDay functionality is not available and this was unexpected. Other services and functionality as expected This is a fantastic product for reading books. It is wonderful to use in full sunshine. I have a kindle fire so I thought this would be unnecessary now I am wishing I had purchased it sooner. The much longer battery life and use in full sunlight make it so much better to use for reading than the kindle fire. I bought this for my daughter who wanted an iPad, but for about half the price she is completely happy with it - she even calls it her iPad. I think I may even buy one for myself to replace my aging iPad. As long as apps are downloaded before leaving WIFI they work great for road trips or hunting trips! Better than I expected. Parental control is an awesome feature. Alexa can do it all! Having a severe hearing loss, the \\'Show\\' gives me visuals along with captions so that I can follow what Alexa is saying! This tablet works great and my daughter loves it. Only reason not 5 stars is because you cant access google play without rooting the tablet. Way to ruin android amazon. Great on the go companion for avid reader. Easy to load books and connect with prime. Love my Echo Plus, echo, echo spot and Ech show. Very satisfied with the products. They work great individually or with each other. Biggest and best Kindle yet. Light as a feather. Buy one today. Nice Tablet for games and keeping up on social media! This tablet is very good for my daughter of age five. My first Kindle and I love it. No backlight and perfect view in the sun are awesome. Its an awesome item. Me and the kids love it. She loves it, she has one of the first Kindles and uses it daily, so this new one was a surprise and she enjoys the color in some of the cookbooks. The clarity and the Washington Post was an added feature, and fact that it was so easy to use. Previously had 2 echo Dots in play at my home, so knew I wanted more from my Alexa. Echo show now in kitchen and allows easy review of youtube for entertainment and recipe instructions. Also like streaming music and having the lyrics stream, too!!! Very cool. Looking forward to Alexa learning more and more to respond to my questions on various topics. Hands free is the way to go. I love new Kindle Fire. I love the convenience having books with me all the time being able to have an entire library at my fingertips. You are able to control you lights and other electrical devices with the Echo Plus We have echos throughout the whole house and have this in the kitchen. Controls lights , you can FaceTime , my wife uses it for recipes and it shows the videos of directions My entire family loves this product. We ask her questions and go to sleep with her playing music. You feel like you have company anytime you want great tablet for a great price and size. Would highly recommend ! I made this purchase for myself to free up space on my phone. Now I use it for books, movies and a lot more! It\\'s amazing. My daughter loves reading on it, watching Netflix, going online to look things up, etc. She loves the touchscreen aspect, and the settings are advanced, but very user friendly. Easy to navigate. Lots of great features for a very low price. The only negative is that the camera is not the best quality. But that\\'s not important to her. Purchased for our 3 year old grandson. He loves it. It exceeded my expectations and recommend this product to friends I love that you can read books as well as play games with this tablet. I bought 2 of them for my little boy and girl. We just charge them up and let them play with them in the car on road trips. They are quite!!! The only thing is, I wish they would have a section of games that can be played without wifi. Some of the apps need wifi to run and some do not. Overall though, I love this tablet! Easy to handle. Light weight. I like that it automatically shuts off when the cover is closed. We love this table for our 5 y.o. It gives him the sense of independence he wants and me the sense of calmness knowing I can control what he gets on and how long he can spend in screen time! I enjoy getting recipes and news via Alexa. Great speakers. It\\'s perfect for me when I\\'m doing homework or just surfing the web when I\\'m at a Starbucks or just at home. This amazon tablet is perfect for first time users. Easy to operate even for a 3 year old. Another great product by Amazon, super fun and great for entertaining the family and guests. This was purchased on Black Friday as an impulse buy and we absolutely love it! It was a great price and the size of the tablet is perfect. It works great! Killer tablet for the price. No issues running any apps or programs. Excellent Ereader if that is all you are looking for. Probably a bit over priced for the casual reader, the Voyage is wonderful for those looking for the best reading experience and are willing to pay the price tag and trade the lack of functionality. We have several, this one was a Christmas gift for our daughter. We love the convenience of creating lists and some home automation. Once you get started, you come up with more things to use it for. Purchased the product for a gift. Has not been used yet This amazon echo is awesome, my girl loves it, im happy My son is 3 and he loves this tablet. It is very educational and worth the money We love that it is portable and can move from room to room effortlessly. Replaced a regular echo with this unit. Allows video chat with our son in college and replaces a digital picture frame at a very affordable price. Great tablet for simple tasks. I bought 2 and I have no complaints. Was a present for my 14 year old grandson. He was very pleased. We are so pleased with this tablet. We purchased one for each of our grandsons. They can all use them, play games together and send messages to the grandparents once in awhile. This product ties in to the Amazon ecosystem better than the Dot or Echo. It provides better sound quality and plays video. Pairing this off with Nest cameras has been the best. So quick and easy. I highly recommend this product. Perfect item for any place in your house. Love the speaker and the different features it does. This item was purchased as a gift for an annual holiday party. The recipient loved it. and practical easy to use just the start of my IOT home My wife loves to read, but she was always hesitant to try ebooks. She used to think that ebooks could never have the same tactile feel as a physical book. I talked her into it by telling her its lighter, easier to hold, can hold thousands of books and if she hated it we can return it. But she loves ebooks now and doesnt want to go back. She also found out that Amazon has a lot of books which cost nothing, namely classics and such...I think. If you like to read in the dark then get the paperwhite version. The LED\\'s are a nice touch. Tablet has worked without a hitch. We bought it for my father, who is just shy of 80. With a couple of instructions, he\\'s been using it without further assistance. We got the Kindle for our daughter who accompanied us to try out the two Kindle models. We were willing to buy either one and we assumed she would want the more expensive one with the backlighting feature. But as she tried both, she gravitated with certainty toward the basic model. \"Why would U want to read in the dark?\" She said. As the weeks and months have gone by, she says she\\'s completely happy with the basic Kindle, it\\'s exactly what she wanted. Perfect. The Fire tablet is great, we just bought our second. It\\'s screen is pleanty big enough to see, but small enough to fit in my jacket pocket. The echo plus is the way to go and with the hue, no need to install a dimmer! We replaced and aging fire HDX. She noticed the WiFi connection is improved and the screen is larger. She prefers this to my iPad Air I love all of them. I would recommend going to Best Buy and buying a kindle fire before they are sold out! Purchased my first Amazon Echo Plus after researching online and watching video reviews. A friend of mine had one and he showed me the features. The device was easy to setup and has worked great since. I use it to control lights, fans and play music. This product is well thoughts the kids seem to like the apps very good product and right on the cost! Great gift for the holidays. I love my echo show it does so many interesting things I‚Äôm on it all the time I recommend it to anyone who enjoys getting up to date information Someone recommended this to us for the 3 and 4 year olds. We bought two as gifts. Best Buy had the best prices. Kids love them and so do we! After purchasing 2 different \"brand X\" charges at a lower cost, and having both of them fail after a couple weeks of use, I purchased this OEM charger (made by Amazon) for our Kindle Fire. Not only does it work well (continuously) but it fully charges the unit in a matter of 2 hours, instead of overnight charging being required. Still works great, and well worth the few dollars extra in price! I enjoy reading with my Kindle Fire. That is the reason I purchased it. Because I do not have Wi-Fi my use is limited. Connects with Echo Dot and Bluetooth with ease. Works great The Echo Plus was demonstrated for us at Best Buy. We were a bit skeptical but bought to check it out. Wow! are we impressed! We tell it to turn on and turn off our lights in the living room, family room, and bedroom. Also it can dim the lights more than once. Need the local weather forecast, just ask. Want to listen to Christmas music? Yes, again. Want to know the distance to someplace or the population of some city or country, yes! We\\'re still discovering what it can do and it seems limitless. Absolutely love this!! I have been greatly impressed with the Alexa. A friend loves calling me and asking her Alexa questions. We share alot of laughs just discovering all the things she can do. So I just had to purchase an Alexa for myself. I\\'m just beginning set my Alexa up. I hope it\\'s easy because I\\'m not tech. salve. I\\'ve got to go and get started with the set-up. Very sturdy for little people who might drop it easy to read This is a great device that actually has a lot of usefulness to it. After about a week you\\'re going to be wondering what else can I do? what else can this help you with? So my suggestion is to get one of these as a start. Then prioritize the purchase of an echo (not plus) and a spot. My wife and I wanted our children to still enjoy the feeling of having an \"iPad\", so we got the Amazon Fire Kids edition. It has been awesome. I love the way you can set limits on the tablet so they\\'re not glued to it all day long. Kids mode is extremely beneficial. This amazon product is amazing easy to set up and to use. I do recommend getting prime music with it for only 4.99 a month that‚Äôs a deal. I have this model Kindle and purchased another for a gift.He is not very savy but Kindle makes it sooo easy, he is happy.Such an easy tablet! I got the amazon Fire HD 10 for reading and other activities. It was very easy to set up. Netflix worked ok on it. It mostly works well, but there are limitations to the apps that are available. I tried it out for a while and then returned it for a Samsung S2 9.7. Love the safety features for parents to protect their little ones from some content on the Internet. Love preloaded programs We use this as a monitor for the amazon cloud camera! Works great we tell it to show us the camera ,and boom, there‚Äôs the video feed. Super easy to link our echo plus and the echo dot with the show!! Tablet is good for beginners and those that like to read I purchased this Kindle Fire for my husband and he loves it. He had an older model which he loved but my dog accidentally broke it. This updated version has so many new features which he loves! The touch screen adds a new dimension to the Echo which comes in handy when ordering off of Amazon or reorders as well. I also like being able to view news briefings and song lyrics on the screen also. The Echo Show is the only way to go. I have several Kindles so knew what to expect. It is a great reading device and I keep several in different locations. I purchased this to pair with my other echo while I enjoy my other 2 echoes I must say there is a noticeably difference with the echo plus and best buy had it at a remarkable price better than amazon so it was win they amped up the speaker I love the Alexa. It has encouraged me to automate my home. Now I have lighting that comes on when I ask, My heat is controlled wherever I am and it\\'s fun asking her (Alexa) questions. I purchased this Kindle for my daughter and she really enjoys using it !! I own the Echo, and love the product! So I purchased the Tap as a gift. It‚Äôs easily connected to my Sony android tv and works great! Brought this small reader for my mom who wanted something larger than her phone to do pintrest and read on. She loves it. I bought this as an upgrade from my old Kindle. Works awesome, i can even watch movies through my Amazon Prime. Plenty of apps to choose from. Awesome little tablet. Light to carry and good picture quality. This was purchased for a hearing impaired person to download video in American Sign Language . This product was easy to maneuver for someone that was not use to a tablet. I bought this kindle for my 11yr old granddaughter for Christmas. Me and my husband both had kindles several years prior, and she and my 6 year old grandson love watching and playing on them. Both children have all kinds of game systems but use the kindle way more. My 6 yr old grandson still plays with mine and loves watching you tube, videos and playing games on it. He has several game systems, Xbox, sega, ds but still uses my kindle all the time over those systems.my husband used his all the time for everything from internet to watching movies and shows. I\\'m getting ready to buy my grandson a new kindle( mine is a bit older and has cracked screen now but still works good).He would like one to call his own. I\\'m looking at a 16 GB or 32 GB.they are really durable and tough. I have not explored all the features of the kindle fire tablet yet. Why does the sound always have to be reset each time? I want it to stay on full sound maximum loudness always. I have to reset it each time I fire it up to listen to music. What\\'s up with that? Please direct me someone!!! WOW THIS IS SO MUCH FUN. WOW IT CAN TELL YOU ANYTHING,PLAY ANY SONG AND MUCH MUCH MORE. The amazon fire tablet is awesome..my kids love it The Fire Tablets are by far the best value on the market. They are parent friendly with the parental controls and kid friendly with he ease of use. I bought this kindle for my 11yr old granddaughter for Christmas. Me and my husband both had kindles several years prior, and she and my 6 year old grandson love watching and playing on them. Both children have all kinds of game systems but use the kindle way more.

I\\'m looking at a 16 GB or 32 GB.they are really durable and tough. This was a excellent gift for the family, A good choice. I bought four of these for my kids and they love them I ordered this for my daughter, as I have the black paperwhite, and I love it. I read quite a bit and the larger books were driving me crazy having to hold them up while laying down, or wanting to take a book on vacation and lugging around a thick paperback, with this I can throw it in my bag and read anywhere. Its light weight, easy to use, the battery life lasts for weeks, which makes it an all around awesome device. My daughter is in public school and they offer an online library for E-Readers, so she can now download books for free from school! You can also download your own public library app (if your county offers that) and read free from there as well. You can shop for e-books straight from the device through Amazon.com. I like this e reader, but wish the screen were higher resolution. It requires decent light to look good, but it is easy on my eyes. The screen updates involve flashing the whole screen, which I noticed less over time. The advertised month long battery life is just standby time, it lasts much less if you are downloading and reading books. Can be dropped, thrown and doesnt break. awesome tablet When I used to think of amazon echo I think flimsy sounds, Amazon Echo was more of ECHO-Ing, tin can complex... at least from what I have experienced with my friends echos. Echo Plus you ask... Not so much!!! This device has such excellent sound!! One of the best devices I have ever purchased! If I could I would have these all over my house. Forget the dot and the echo 2nd gen. Echo plus is the way to go!!! Beautiful device, sounds is second to none! Full disclosure. I own five Amazon echos including a few Dots as well as this Tap, so obviously I\\'m a fan of echoes. Honestly I couldn\\'t figure out from Amazons marketing and the online review how the Tap fit in as compared to full blown Echo and the Dot. I kept thinking it was limited compared to the Echo and the Dot because you had to Tap the button to ask it question. However given that it\\'s completely portable and runs for up to six hours on a charge it makes sense that it would wast battery if it was always listening for a voice command. IMO, the Tap sounds just as good and maybe even better the the Echo in a much smaller form factor. Since it\\'s portable it\\'s probably going to be sitting next to you any way so tapping to ask a question is not really an issue and in someways is better when you have a full table as you can control who gets to request music. My friends and I get into fun wars asking for different music on the full blown Echo but it can also get a little annoying when someone plays Michael Bolton over my Bruce Springsteen. Bottom line just as good of sound as the full blown Tap in a portable and smaller form. Very Happy with all my echoes but this may be my favorite. This is a great tablet. There are thousands of books and movies and music to choose from the Amazon store. It is very easy to navigate I truly enjoy this product. I have an older one but this is superb in all areas of entertainment. I bought this as a gift to my dad and he loves it. Well worth if you dont plan on reading in dark. Great tablet for the money so cheap that I use it for a stand alone interface for my fish tank Its great, just needs expanding information on it. Perfect for what I need to use it for movies etc great for a gift I bought this for my brother and his wife. They love it! Not only does it control their Nest thermostat, it works with their expanding environment of Philips Hue bulbs. Overall, the tablet is well constructed and well engineered. The \\'excited factor\\' for my son wore off quickly, including the included app services. Nothing negative to report, but nothing unexpected in a positive sense either. If you are looking for an entry level tablet, this is it.The Kindle fire HD is perfect for kids! Bought this as a gift for my daughter and it was a good buyShock proof and great educational apps for kids in it with alexa in control you may need extra time to jog I love hear readers, I had to replace mine because I destroyed the last, but it is awesome My 8 year old loves this so much to do on it. She enjoys reading on it play games . This was a perfect gift for my friend. Obsessed with reading and has been perfect for starting a greater library of books... Very easy to use and extremely affordable. Very happy with this purchase, and will buy more for family and friends! Absolutely love the Amazon Alexa devices, we now have six in our house and have them connected to Sonos, nest, Arlo and other devices Quality comes with apps installed durrible love the case I use this tablet as an e-reader and to listen to prime music at the same time. Great for this.Still leaning other features. My family have enjoyed ALEXA in the house, she is very smart and she does lots of research for the family! We are truly glad that we made the purchase My grand daughter loves it and so do her parents! Very durable. I\\'d highly recommend this product Purchased this for my 83 year old mother to primarily use as an e-reader. It seems as this may be easier for her to see than an actual book. She does not always find new technology easy to use, but seems to be doing ok with this tablet. She also is using it to play solitaire and possibly some other games. Easy and simple for my grandson to use. Has no problem using it. Love this device, performs perfectly! Plays music and lures lights off and on by command. Love the new Echo Show! Picture is clear and the microphones pick up my voice from far away. My wife likes it for recipes on the go and the Show it is always thinking. Music sounds great coming from this small unit. It was the talk of Christmas! Easy to use and navigate, purchasing books is fast and simple and I love the fact that I can password protect this device The first thing we noticed was Alexa‚Äôs response time to questions. No waiting or downloading just lightning quick responses. 2nd was the compatibility with our smart hone features. She connects to our lights and security monitoring system with ease. She is clear and concise. This is the best tablet for a kids tablet. The modified Android operating system with Amazon features built-in is great. I am reviewing for what it is, a KIDS TABLET. It has a 1.3 gigahertz processor, meaning for such a small device that decently enough. Internal memory is 8 gigs but you can expand to 256 gigabytes. You wont run out of memory. It has a 2 megapixel camera that shoots in 720p, meaning not full 1080 hd or 4k. Again, if you bought it for a camera you\\'d be wrong, but for a kid 2 years to 12 years old, that\\'s good. It has 1 gig of ram so it is kind of sluggish on more detailed games. Our 2 year old isn\\'t playing any heavy graphics games that take up the CPU and GPU. It came with a nice rubber case for drop protection and she has thrown it a few times excitedly and it did its job. It has no resource hogging GPS or RADIO but it does have bluetooth and Wi-Fi. I needed a kindle for my schooling so I decided to look into this and read some reviews. After reading the reviews I decided on this kindle and it is perfect compared to my other tablet. The Amazon fire tablet is a great gift for kids of all ages . Ez and fun to use keeping kids entertained while giving them educational tools to use at their grade level and hire. My Grandson loves his tablet we got him. Very safe My dad uses this as a speaker for the tv ...and loves it. He does use it in the traditional Alexa way...but the speaker option he discovered is an added benefit. Replaced a kindle 6 that crashed so fare everything is great. Larger screen fast response,more storage. Don\\'t have to charge as often. Well pleased. I have two dots and this and the functionality between them is awesome. I can‚Äôt wait to see how it improves through time. Great quality speaker and build. My granddaughter loves it. It was a perfect gift for her long airplane trip. We\\'re hoping the Echo show will allow us to elevate our experiences using the screen options for calling family & friends as well as reading recipes etc. Nice device I like to use it to read books online. Reliable with great memory and storage. Excellent battery life. Would recommend to young and old. I purchased this as present for a friend and since I have an Echo I can video chat with her to check in. The quality of the video is great. I am loving my Amazon Echo Show. It makes life easier! I love being able to ask what the weather is going to be or play some music just by asking Alexa. I also love being able to video call friends and family that have an Echo Show or the Alexa App. Overall it is a great product! This is my second Kindle and I love it. It\\'s lightweight, simple, and fast. It\\'s convenient for trips and fits in my bag without weighing it down. If you love Amazon, you\\'ll love the Kindle HD8. It\\'s a great size for reading all those books, streaming movies and tv shows, and has great sound for listening to your favorite music. For less than $100, you can\\'t beat the versatility of this little device! Bought this tablet after a cheaper model quit working. I found all my cloud items already available being Prime Member. its fast, it has good lighting. its got the 16gb space, best gift ive bought for a bookreader. This is my second kindle. Have a few more items to learn. But love it. Easy to get around the apps. My daughter loves it. She can read books and watch movies. Bought this tablet for our 2 year old. She loves to watch videos of nursery rhymes and Bubble Guppies. I can finally get some housework done without interruption. So user friendly, even a 2 year old can figure it out! Tablet good for kids and some adults. Price and screen resolution were also a selling point. My grandson really enjoys this tablet, ease of use and lots of different educational programs. Must remember to charge tablet everynight. I reviewed a lot of tablets before I bought this one. It is the first one I have ever purchased. I am no tech geek and it was pretty easy to figure out how to use it. I mostly bought it for and use it for: reading e-mail, facebook, and browsing the internet. I really like it and use it more than my laptop. But, if I need to do anything detailed, I use my laptop. Overall it\\'s a great tablet for a beginner, and you can\\'t beat the price. Use it in bathroom to listen to my amazon music and with Alexa you can control it with just your voice still learning new things about my tablet. very easy to use.. perfect size. I like being able to turn on lights, music and the thermostat in our home! Alexa Show is really well put together. The main reason for my purchase was to create my own \\'surveillance system\\' linking my Ring Doorbell, and Ring Floodlights to view on command by Alexa on the Show Screen. Yes, you can talk to it, and get results for almost any query, but with the show, you get a lot more. The touch screen is great for video calls, especially when you install the Alexa App on your family cell phones. Alexa can scan items via UPC and order them on Amazon, or tell you where to get them. The recipes you ask for are not only spoken to you, but SHOWN to you. Also, when music plays, you can see the lyrics on screen (If you use Amazon Music to play the music). You can ask for a news briefing, and you SEE the news, highlights, etc. The speakers aren\\'t quite up to the same standard as the echo series, but it\\'s close. The sound fills the room nicely. When the Echo Show is not being immediately used, the screen shows a picture of your choice, making it a digital frame too. Overall, the device is very nice, and they are constantly releasing new skills for Alexa to use, so it seems like there is always something new to wow you. Turning on and off lights, adjusting your thermostat, playing music, viewing security cameras are all just the standard duties, there is WAY more to do with this device! Bought it for a couple of my friends and it was a big hit with them! Very useful! This tablet is great for kids and adults who have little to no knowledge of computers. It handles easily and has plenty of storage This is great tablet. Its great for people who don\\'t need a lot of apts. or store a lot on it. Doesn\\'t over heat. Light weight. I bought this as an affordable alternative to the iPad mini. I liked the expandable storage option and size. Super easy to use. Unfortunately granddaughter wanted and iPad mini to go with her other apple products. So I ended up returning it. In hindsight I should\\'ve kept it for myself. This is a great addition to the other Alexa products by Amazon. It works great in the kitchen. Better voice recognition and sound. The onscreen display and information are very helpful. The video capability is watching instructional videos or even playing music videos while working/cooking. It can also scroll personal photos as a picture display.All in all Echo Show is a wonderful addition. Well worth it, especially if you get it on sale. Great sound and picture. Been using as a baby monitor. Still new to Alexa so still learning what she can do I love this product! I love everything about it!!! We love this table for our 5 y.o. It gives him the sense of independence he wants and me the sense of calmness knowing I can control what he gets on and how long he can spend in screen time! My child loves playing with the Kindle fire. It is entertaining and educational. Kindles are an excellent device for all book lovers Excellent tablet.....withstands a special needs Grandson. Love my kindle it\\'s the best size for the price. Wonderful applications to download for reading, play movies and music. A plus rating I have a couple of these echos, they are wonderful they do everything like turn my lights on or the TV, my granddaughter love asking it question Very cool - It fully incorporates all of my Smart Home products Awesome.and repeat 50 times. That should do it. Blah. It is amaizin I like the way you type and search my favorites Love the bigger speaker and the quality of sound with this product. Like turning on bedroom light with Alexa. This is a great entry level Alexa product. The speaker is adequate, but the inclusion of the Philip‚Äôs hue bulb makes it feel like a good deal Bought two of these for my kids for Christmas. Love the level of control it gives me to supervise and monitor usage. I had the 4th generation. I am quite happy with the upgrade. Good battery life I love the echo show it is in my kitchen and we use it almost daily to listen to music while we cook and also to find new recipes to try, my kids use it to help with homework, my whole family uses it with ease and everyone loves it. Happy I bought this. Makes everything easier to control. Our kids love it and the Amazon unlimited is fantastic with tons of options. However, our kids still fight over usin our grownup tablet bc the screen is larger. First bought the Dot to see if we liked it. We enjoyed it, but wanted a little more volume. When I saw that the Show was much louder and had the camera we decided it was the right choice. Now we have the Dot in the bedroom and the Show in the living room. For larger rooms the Show is a great choice. Late gift for my grandson. He is very happy with it. Easy for him (9yo ). My daughter can‚Äôt wait to get this set up in her room Works great with my Ring doorbell and Ring security cameras. Love that I can see live feeds on my Echo show I wanted something small to read books on on the go. This fit the bill perfectly! Not to big and not to small. It does more things than I was expecting! Over all pretty good product.i am not so sure if it\\'s got Bluetooth connectivity. i\\'ve had it for a few months now and kids seem to enjoy it a lot.certainly I recommend to anyone who wants to give their kids the \"best \"gift. Excellent value priced 10\" tablet. To bad Amazon killed it. I purchased it as a gift for my wife and she loves the size and quality of the display. Got this for two days during the holidays. Very good service I\\'m super happy and very glad I made this purchase! The kids love it and easy to understand. Great parental controls as well. Got this for my wife. She uses it daily to read She really lokes it. This tablet was SO easy to set up, even this old technologically-challenged grandma did it without help! I am able to load many books on it. It is convenient and easy to handle. Great Product, User Friendly and can\\'t be beaten for the promotion prices. I bought a kindle fire 2 years ago and enjoyed using it, I always wished for more storage and better connectivity. This new model has both and I can use with my amazon account. cool tablet that you can use daily, just freezes a bit, but the reset button works well. I have several versions of Amazon\\'s Echos - the original, and Echo Plus, 2 Taps and 2 Dots. The Show is the best sounding of the bunch and you have the screen as a bonus. I added a battery pack to make it portable and it\\'s perfect for us. Leapfrog is a great learning tool for preschoolers and beyond my grandson loves it I got everything I need for personal use. A great value for a cheap price. I am very pleased with my purchase the tablet is a great project is there a product is very versatile Great tablet, fast & reliable. Only downfall is having to pay to remove adds. It\\'s a fine tablet for the price the only problem I have with theach kids mode it\\'s not what I was thought it\\'s going to be I returned it back just be of this reason This is the favorite of the house, even our visitors love it, is amazing! I bought two of these Amazon Fire HD tablets in December as Christmas gifts. Both recipients are happy with these as gifts. I plan to purchase one in the near future for myself. Good for reading white and blackScreen is still small I am loving my new Kindle! I have wanted one for a while and finally bought one, and even though it was the cheapest one, it has exceeded my expectations. I love how there is no glare. I got this for reading books, I still like ipad better though. The thick edge makes it easier to read than the voyage and PW. very fast and responsive. I wish the devise was longer then it would feel more like a real book rather than a CD case Like this so much bought another one for my daughter. Music, full home automation control, an assistant, calling, shopping and lists, much much more...anywhere with wifi, home or away. Get one, you will not regret it. The kindle over all is great. There\\'s only one thing I would want better and that is the speaker. My last kindle was louder. I really miss the louder speaker. I purchase this for my wife; it work well but I think that this version es too expensive, the difference is a light Love not having to carry books and being able to get a variety of books. Love this new Echo Show.The best in the Alexa family Great tablet and kid case. I just wish it came with kids apps. I love the apps that are on here and everything else I think it\\'s the perfect tablet for a beginner has all of the apps that you will need It\\'s nice but not as easy to switch profiles as I would like for it being a child\\'s tablet. But overall easy to use just a lot of junk on main profile. Tablet is perfect for beginners who just want basic Got this tablet to replace the one that had the screen cracked, cheaper than getting the screen replaced Great device to stay in touch with your family if you leave in another city or state! My mom loves the kindle fire hd 8. She had the first kindle and it was time for an upgrade! Great buy for her birthday present!! For the price the tablet can not be beat. I use this over my ipads that i have. There is nothing i cant do with this tablet So easy to set up. Still learning what she can do. Happy so far. I‚Äôve enjoy my echo since I purchased it ! The light bulbs are great to I will be buying more products I have a Kindle and my grandson uses it when he comes to visit. We decided to get him one. I feel the audio on the show is the best when compared to the echo, echo 2.0, and obviously dot. Nice to have next to bed instead of a dot and an alarm clock Fun and easy to use. Music sounds great. Set timers, reminders and sync your calendar. I\\'m giving one as a gift to my daughter so we can video chat with \"drop in\" any time. Good for smaller kids that cannot play or get to play on Xbox games with 7 other Siblings Echo show easy to set up. Wish it included the swivel base that is a option now. Love the added video! Great tablet. Drop it many times and its still working. Got this as a present for my fianc√© for Christmas will update I really love my kindle its easy to handle to. I have 3. My girlfriend loves the echo show, I bought two of them... Not the paperwhite, but for the price I paid works great for my kids to carry around multiple books they need to read for school Very satisfied. Price was great. The curved screen is nice but I believe you get more TV with straight screen. I believe it is just a viewers choice. We have a sound system so I can\\'t speak about the sound. Got this for my mother who\\'s eye site has been failing to the point of not being able to dial the phone or write down appointments. She can now video chat with members of the family. Send emails, check her appointments, place phone calls just by requesting it. It has helped her so much. This has been a great purchase. It fits all my tablet and e-reader needs. Kid proof and works well!! There are plenty of apps too! I purchased this for my daughter, and she loves it! I love the user friendly parental controls! Great quality, great price and best of all has good sound. A must have!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Everyone should get one. Most of the time I use the tablet for the Web, reading and email, but when I want to work on a Word doc, pdf, budget and a lot more, I can do it well on the tablet without pulling out my laptop. The screen isn\\'t as sharp as the S2 models but is nice enough and it does not lack anything else. A great tablet for the price--really no major complaints! Bought this for my parents\\' home and it\\'s awesome. The quality of the sound is amazing. It\\'s also helpful to get quick questions answered when they\\'re running around or out of the house. I need to now purchase one for my own apartment. Also great when hosting guests. Works well. I really like the bigger screen (up from the 7\"). Easier to read, just as easier to use if not better. Is it operate my wife loves it my granddaughter knows how to operate a good sounding Bluetooth speaker great freedom it even tells knock knock jokes in makes my granddaughter crack up that makes it worth every penny I paid useful to recommend to anybody I\\'ve had my other Kindle Fire for 5-6 years. It\\'s still working but slowing down. I bought the updated version while it was on sale. I love it! I play games on it, download books, check my email and facebook. It\\'s like a portable mini computer and I wouldn\\'t be without it. I like it better than other people\\'s tablets and you can\\'t beat the price. I bought some for gifts and everybody loves it! I\\'d recommend it to people of all ages. I bought 1 a year ago for our oldest kid. Came back this year and bought two more. Built really well. This is the best choice for a kids tablet. Amazon has made another great product! The ‚Äúshow‚Äù goes perfectly in the kitchen! Recipes, music,weather! All done hands free!! Fast set up! My 6 yr old daughter got this tablet from Santa for Christmas. So far she loves it, a little too much perhaps.. I only use it to manage her account/permissions and so far haven\\'t had any issues with it.. Software and HW not quite as refined as apple iPad products, but what can you expect at the lower price point. Good tablet for my daughter! She loves it ,but she gets annoyed how the battery runs out quickly! Purchased this as a child\\'s tablet and I couldn\\'t be happier! I was buying it thinking that it would be cut-rate but ok for a small child to play with on long car rides and on rainy days. Despite the low cost and unimpressive stats I have been very surprised by the quality. The screen is perfectly adequate for games and kids shows, the parental controls/child profile settings are excellent and the stereo speakers CRUSH the built in speakers on my iPad Air 2. The only drawbacks I have found so far are power related. The battery seems to drain fairly quickly under what I would consider normal use and the included charger (typical usb type) takes a very very long time to fully charge the tablet. I suspect this is the charger\\'s limitation rather than the tablet\\'s and it may charge better with a different power supply.I wish that I had purchased two of these tablets at the price they were for sale and I would have kept the second for my own use when on the road. The features that I found on the Fire tablet far exceeded my expectations. Well worth the purchase price. I was looking for a tablet for my 5 year old. This tablet was definitely worth the price and it\\'s not a \"kiddie\" tablet, as she calls them. My son has the Hd fire used for last 3 years, I bought this one for my moms birthday. She loves it. It\\'s easy to navigate and the ability to increase the size of the print allows for the smaller screen cheaper price :) I bought this for my 25 year old son for Christmas. He loves it! This is a must have is great for recepies, while you are cooking Alexa gives you the info. For the ines that are used to a tablet or iPod that you have to stop and read this is awesome plus. So much easier to follow things. This my second kindle .. it\\'s light and faster than my previous kindle ..came with free audio books for 30 days which is cool ... better screen .. it does seem to be long than wider .. which I\\'m ok with and I got this on sale for 60 .. great deal My first tablet. OUTSTANDING for NETFLIX, email, etc. I love all of the things you can do with the Echo. I am still learning everything I can do and look forward to more content going forward. Bought as birthday present for grandson and he plays with it daily and with the case on it he hasn\\'t broken it either. My 5 year old loves his tablet. It\\'s perfect for him. Good value, enjoy using it! I recommend this highly! The Amazon fire is simply amazing I would not buy anything else. Great addition to my Alexa collection. Very portable, batter lasts as expected. GREAT PRICE FOR HOLIDAYS COMBO WORKS WELL NO NEED FOR EXTERNAL HUB I love the Echo Show and this is the 3rd one I have purchased (two were presents for family at Christmas). This one was for me. I love being able to hear music, connect with family via video and ask Alexa questions. Best purchase I could have made! Nothing is perfect (even IPad). But for what you can do with this product for this price it is real excellent. Have more than one. One for work and one for home. Just the right size for reading books and playing some games. My 2yr old daughter loves it! Perfect Xmas gift! Bought it for my grandson for Christmas and he loves it Smaller overall size with the same screen size of our older kindle fire. Faster processor. It a great product..,. The quality is awesome the pictures is good and clear... I love this solutions for my kids. I gave it a four star rating because in order to install Apps you just have to tap the icon. Well my Two year old and five year old went tap crazy, like a Kangaroo on a Pogo stick. Needless to say the ran out of room quickly. I tried to teach them to not launch apps that weren\\'t installed but they still have a problem discerning what is installed and what isn\\'t. Aside from this, it is a fantastic device for kids to play and learn with. I especially like the parental control features. I just wish they would put in a feature for controlling what gets installed. Young kids love it, easy to use and takes a beating but still cheap enough that if it does happen to break you don\\'t break the bank too Awesome sound which was unexpected. It\\'s nice seeing info on the screen such as recipes, song lyrics, weather, etc. Really enjoy having the echo to use to control the lights and music in our house We use echo almost every day. It is fun to ask questions. The music is great. We check the weather and listen to NPRnews The Amazon fire was a gift for my mom and she seems to really enjoy it. I have one so I bought her this one for her birthday. She enjoying all the games she downloaded. Works great. Very responsive and quick. I love tying the whole house together with this and the echoes. Amazon has consistently delivered quality tablets at the best prices and this is no exception. Nice starter tablet for my nephew. Does what we need it to do. Worked fine first time out of the box. Plug it in, set it up with you Amazon account and you are ready to go. It is very convenient to turn on and off the Phillips light by voice. This fire tablet has long battery life. Reasonable fast The unit does a good job of playing music from Amazon music. It hears your voice very good although it gets confused at times when I tell it to turn on a particular lamp and I have to slowly pronunciate it. Like that the music shows the lyrics. Do need a family account on Amazon music to plan different music on different units in different rooms at the same time though. Great product easy to set up and use my child loves it best money I ever spent for my grand child she just love it I live the echo show! So easy to set up and use. I have one in the kitchen and one in our main bathroom. The Amazon-Fire is an inexpensive WiFi device we use for answering messages and is quickly shifted from person to person as well as moved from room to room. The show is an all in one Alexa-enabled machine. I love the words to the songs and I\\'m all about being able to watch my amazon prime videos. Excellent tablet with nice screen. I wish Amazon would pre install the play store, this would have been perfect. This is the best purchase I\\'ve mad in a tablet my daughter loves it With this you have someone to talk to and answers you. I love the tablets HD picture is beautiful. The fire tablet is very fast to load and is easy to use. Great tablet. Purchased this for my grandson. It works great. However, if I were to do it over again I would spend the extra $$$ to get the one without the ads. They drive you crazy. The ads make the cheaper unit really frustrating. I love my kindle it makes it so much easier to read books instead of having to carry them with me Works great for my daughter, great price and apps. Good inexpensive device. Still in touch with modern technology. I wondered about buying one before making the decision - now even after just a few weeks I wonder how I managed. It has some gimmicky things yes but also can help out with a lot of very useful ideas such as weather, traffic and lists. Would recommend one to anyone I really like it it‚Äôs user-friendly and I was by 55 Coolidge from Apple family to the family Another great echo product... really cool feature is the lyrics scrolling across the screen when playing music! Despite a less than friendly price point (if you don\\'t get it on sale), this Amazon item is well designed and delivers on the promises in the hype and product description. The emphasis with this item is \"show\", so it\\'s no surprise that sound quality does not compare with the Echo, but if you want the convenience of a voice controlled screen other than your phone, this product delivers. It\\'s value is even greater when paired with other smart devices such as security cams. Another added bonus comes when friends or family also have a Show, so that you can do \"drop in\", which is essentially visual phone calls. It\\'s great for checking on elderly family because it does not require them to be technically savvy. Grandson is enjoying the new games on it. It\\'s much bigger than his ipod. This game seems to be another good addition to the Pokemon craze. My son got this for Christmas and has played it often since. He says that it\\'s \"awesome\", which is high praise indeed. This was an Xmas gift for my wife. She had wanted a pad of some sort but I just couldn\\'t afford an Ipad so I looked at the Fire as an alternative. First the screen size was just what I wanted. Second the price was very reasonable. Third it had functions and capabilities that were suitable for my wife\\'s skills and needs. She absolutely loves it and I actually got a compliment on my present giving. That don\\'t happen very often let me tell you. I will recommend this she\\'s pleased I\\'m pleased what else do you need? My son was able to piggyback off of this gift, and purchased her the cover to go with it. So it really worked for my family. And I made my wife happy . I like this Kindle the only this is it does not read the books as good as my older Amazon Kindle Fire. Purchased the Echo Show for my wife and she loves it! Full of great information, weather and more. Can control lights and various things at the house. Even askes you the question of the day! Easy set up and to use. Mainly bought it to monitor the Arlo Pro 2 cameras we purchased. My child loves her tablet and I love it. It keeps her busy with learning games and books This tablet is so great for school children to play and learn on. I own multiple echoes and I like the show the best. The screen adds a lot of value in my opinion. I really like being able to see upcoming calendar events and daily news. My kids like watching cartoons from Amazon Prime while eating breakfast. The speakers are great and put out more than enough quality sound for their size. At $149 it was a great deal. Was very difficult to set up. With the 3 hours help of Geek Squad and my granddaughters I-Phone we got it done. Quite an upgrade from the original Fire. The deletion of the carousel was a welcome change. The new turn style approach is faster and more consice. Still don\\'t know why a chime sounds? Also miss the ease of making notes while reading. There has got to be a better way to organize books. Trying to figure out series, trilogies etc. Is impossible, and if you buy a series in a set then the chances are good that Amazon won\\'t pick up a new purchase as a book already read. I love the the Kindles!! Bought this for my grandson. Impressed with the 2 years no questions asked warranty. I like this product but have problems with it turning itself on when just charging it. also several times it shut down and I had to go to reinstall factory settings losing my stuff. Alot of new options I do not use but several of my friends like. Bought 2 for each of my children ( 10 & 15) and they love them. I was a little worried about them adapting to a new operating system, no problems there. The sound and playback images are just fine. They take them everywhere, not like leaving their other tablets at home, I\\'m thinking about buying me one. Very kid durable My 2 year old granddaughter carries her tablet everywhere. She loves it. Echo Plus has everything the old Echo had, plus better sound and built-in capability for Smart Home add-ons, like Hue bulbs and SmartThings plugs ‚Äî without needing a Hue hub or ST hub. Love it! Making a gift baskey and choose to place this Kindle Fire as the main surprise. Great price! I love all my Alexa\\'s I have the Echo and now for Christmas I got the Echo show. Not I can see my recipes and also connect with my family. Reasonably priced and worth every penny! I love it. Wanted one that played bejeweled blitz. This one does not. Gift for my mother for Christmas. It\\'s her first tablet. Right price to see if she likes it or not. I have owned several kindles. I don\\'t know what I do to them, but they tend to die rather quickly. Thank goodness for Best Buy\\'s extra protection. The last two that quit on me were replaced quickly and effortlessly. Excellent customer service as well! I bought my Kindle about 2 months ago and the battery is already dead and will not charge My granddaughter loves this system. It is easy for her to hold, and she loves to play games on it. Cons:Isn\\'t compatible with some of my Google apps that I use daily.Does not operate the latest Facebook updates.Camera image quality is poor.Pros:Smooth interface, user friendly.Good battery life.Supports kids\\' separate profiles so that it may be shared by family members.Easily syncs with other devices. I purchased this tablet for a 6 yr old and it is very easy for him to use. Very happy with the HD Fire 16GB. Plenty of memory and easy to navigate. I would definitely recommend this item. The Amazon Fire HD8 is a great buy, very inexpensive but delivers great quality. Give a 4 rating and not 5 because there are advertisements on lock screen. Some may welcome the ads others not. Overall this tablet is great. Battery life is several days with very minimal usage. Battery lasts 7 to 12 hours with average usage including video. What impressed me the most was the amount of free kids apps that you get with the Kindle. These are easy to use in both size and software. Got for my aunt for her first tablet. It has been user friendly for her, she yours it mostly for reading My son LOVES it! Easy to use and download books. Requested for his Birthday gift. My son loves this product. He plays video games and watch movies on his tablet. We also use it for learning. There are several learning apps you can download on this product. Great way to introduce family and friends to A.I. Technology. Nice tablet for a kid or teenager no allot of memory. Smart Home=Happy Home!This lightbulb is simple...all you need to do is speak to it My daughter loves her kindle! Seems to keep her busy!! Very happy with my purchase. The tablet works amazingly good for the price. My daughter is totally enjoying her tablet.Recently though, it is not charging correctly. I will come to store to have it looked at. This is the forth kindle we have bought for grandchildren. With a spongy protective case, they take them everywhere. So I went to the store, purchased and gifted.it was a snap. amazon fire 7 inch tablet is a great product and works great and no issues Alexa runs my entire house. The Echo show is a great addition to the Echo family. Everyone needs one! I like the fact that it comes w/a case. It\\'s easy for the child to operate, instructions are clear. The Amazon echo is excellent. Easy to set up, and we now use it to automate the entire house from our air-conditioning thermostat to every light in the house with the Phillips hue bulbs. We went and got one for everyone in our family. Im happy to have it. Very comfortable and easy to use every where I bought 50 of these to use in a school education program. The workers at Best Buy assured me the apps I needed them to run would work fine. Unfortunately I was not aware that Amazon has it\\'s own app store unrelated to Apple and GogglePlay. Make sure whatever apps you want to run are also available on the Amazone app store as not all are. Specifically they block anything related to Goggle. Other than that the tablet is great and is a great price and really nice case. Bought this for my grandson along with a case for his birthday. He loves it and all the apps available for a kid his age. Great for my kids and is easy to block purchases. Even better if you have amazon prime. Purchased this for my grandchildren for Christmas and they absolutely love it, haven\\'t put it down since they received them...Thanks Best Buy!!! My daughter loves this tablet. She cant keep her hands off it... Tablet works great. Nice big size good battery power. No problems using it. Super excited to give this as a gift. It\\'s super convenient that Best Buy has Echo products in store instead of having to purchase from Amazon. One of the best tablets. Good for watching YouTube and reading as well. Great tablet for destructive toddlers. My son has dropped and thrown it several times and it still works!... This tablet is quite durable. The pink is vibrant and it\\'s very easy for little fingers to hold. My granddaughter loves it. As above a high class e reader. Love it. Use it at least 2-3 hrs daily. Great device for music and face time calls. The sound is crisp and clear. Many options with the Echo Show The kindle fire is great especially the kid version. The free time app keeps the kids out of my files and prevents them from messing with tablet settings. I wanted to get something nice for my wife and this did the trick. I\\'ll get flowers next time. I like this smart machine and will recommend to my friends a gift. He LOVES it. was a reasonable price. thks. Got this thing around Black Friday and only paid about 50 something bucks. Awesome equipment you can actually stream the web very glad I bought it can\\'t believe it so inexpensive! Great Christmas gift! The hubby loved it . Just read the manual before setting up!! Great for games and reading. Price was great. Great battery life. Well worth the money. Here are my pros and cons thus far.PRO:Perfect size for Ebooks, and web surfing to alleviate strain on the eyes from my 5\" phone displaynice sturdy casing that gives it a nice heft but still weighs in as one of the lighter tablets on the marketChild Accounts- Amazon allows you to set up this tablet with age restricted access for kids making this a low cost piece of tech that is perfect for school kids and allows mom and dad to ration the amount of time lil Johnny can play Clash of Clans and how much he can hit the ol\\' Visa card for.Battery life thus far; wife was on it for about 5 hours last night and battery was at about 46%Kindle Integration -this goes without saying but having my ebooks and audible books synced to the tablet is awesome and my Kindle books look great I really like that my child is engaged with all of the different apps we have downloaded. This is the 3rd one I\\'ve purchased. I\\'ve bought one for all of my nieces. No other case compares to this one. It has held protected the tablet so many times from them dropping it. I love Amazon Fire HD8... It is so easy to use and perfect for reading books on or cruising Social Media. I love that it has Alexa included on it. This has been perfect for the kitchen, it plays music & I can sing along with the words on the screen. Love that Alexa also allows for multiple timer settings when cooking. Love the concept and how I can make my whole house a smart house. If reading is what you do the most with your tablet, this is good choice! This Amazon Echo is very user friendly, and provides hours of entertainment, with anything from recipes, news, videos, and Amazon music with the lyrics is like having your own Karaoke. Give this product a 10 tons of great learning programs. I upgraded from Echo and have no regrets. I didn\\'t liked design from day 1 but after mounting on the wall the screen looks good. I like it more then I except it. Much easier for reordering or shopping on Amazon. My husband loves this Kindle. He has a muscular disease keeping him from being able to handle anything with much weight at all. This is perfect. Seems to work well. Screen quality is good. Like the size. If you use an Echo, you will love the Echo Show. Bought this one for a relative after they experienced mine. My teenager loves this and uses it daily. We\\'ve also took it places with us and the sound is great. Saw Echo dot at my parents. Had to have one. Then I saw the plus. It was so easy to set up. Love the the music steaming. Love the light bulb that came with mine. Makes my life so much easier when I don‚Äôt have an empty hand. Guess what, I went back and bought one for my sister for Christmas. Very pleased. Used it as a bluetooth speaker and love how I can use Spotify with it....just say Alexa, and ask for your favorite artist..... I didn\\'t expect this device to be so diverse unexpected surprise Purchased to stay in touch with family while traveling. Great product for quickly charging your Kindle!!!! This is an awesome device, but it isn\\'t life changing. It is basically the same as the Echo. I don\\'t use the video much. Very easy to use distance is sometime an issue for Alexa hearing at times I really like the auto on off feature. Volume control could be more ergonomic. It may be cheap but this is a great tablet and works awesome. I love this product and plan to expand my Alexa and Echo network. very good product and service will refer a friend. This was the first tablet we purchased for our kids and love it. I prefer spending the extra $70 or $80 to get the echo Pretty cool kids love it. Always adding things to my grocery list I didn\\'t want. Great tablet for under $100. Does not have the highest specs, but gets the job done for lite tablet users. Bought this tablet for my son..great battery life, shipped fast..great value! I am so delighted I purchased this tablet for my toddler son! Pros: The rubber case allows the tablet to take quite a beating, which was crucial for this purchase. Another huge pro is that adults can use the tablet under their own sign-on which works like any other tablet. From the adult sign-on you can customize what your kids can watch, screen time allowance, and add or remove apps for them. The price isn\\'t bad compared to the price of adult tabletsCons:Kind of bummed I can\\'t link my Google Play apps I purchased but I guess it makes sense this is not a Google/Android product. The battery life isn\\'t all that great, but the charger is fast!I wish there was a freeze option that would prevent kids from hitting the screen while watching Netflix or other videos Highly recommend for anyone with young children. You won\\'t be disappointed! Great product, easier set up than anticipated. Actually bought for my Mother - she loves it. I bought this for my young grand daughter to start teaching her basic colors and numbers. She uses it like a pro and we have a great variety of teaching games. Her parents just bought one for their house. Have been using for a year and still working like new. Love it so far but I have a lot to learn yet. My son loves it also. Simply does everything I need. Thank youAnd silk works wonders I use this speaker daily and love the sound quality and its ability to be independant of my phone/tablet unlike normal Bluetooth speakers that require your phone to play music even if they have the same sound quality. I have not stopped reading on this amazon fire. Love it!! I resisted getting this since I already have two Echo units and one Dot. Black Friday gave me reason to buy one. I LOVE IT twice as much as the regular Echo. The set up is faster and easier and I love the visuals. I use my Shopping List and To Do List A LOT and having it display and being able to edit it without logging into the app makes it so much more worth it. I may be getting another :) Didnt know how much i\\'d use a kindle so went for the lower end. im happy with it, even if its a little dark The Amazon Show is a great addition to the Smart Home, easy to set up and to link up with a hub. Good device. My previous one was inherited and has a cracked screen. Love this. Just replaced my old echo with this one. Love Alexa. Love it along with the Fire Stick works great. Works great with the voice Very satisfied. Use it daily while watching TV and other activites Purchased this as a gift for my wife because her B&N Nook was dying. She absolutely loves it, especially since it does so much more. I\\'m now waiting for my Nook to start acting up so that I have an excuse to get a Kindle for myself. This is a great tablet. There are thousands of books and movies and music to choose from the Amazon store. It is very easy to navigate Love it. Best charger I ever bought. Quickly charges my Kindle and my cell phone. My son loves it. There are a lot of kid friendly apps available. 4 stars only because its s e is bing. works great with arlo cameras My daughter loves it. So easy to set up. And keeps everything age appropriate. I recommended is very good and practice. Play music is very good quality speaker I see video. I love This is a great tablet for my 3 year old grandson. The cover is great in that, if he drops it, it won\\'t break! Great buy Great device, but I noticed based on the WiFi connection that Alexa can react slower at times. Especially when asking the device to turn off bulbs, or any smart devices. Exactly what I was looking for size wise and functional. Love everything about my Kindle. I\\'m a long-term Amazon Prime member. The tablet is okay.. my daughter uses it most of the time. I observe my 4 year old granddaughter using this tablet with ease. She is able to play some of the games and upload movies. Her mom had to put a secret password for the movies because she downloaded some that you had to pay for! I bought this as a gift. I think it is pretty decent both quality and design. My son loves this tablet. It is easy for him to navigate and extremely durable. Great and fun , almost like having someone in the room with you Bought this for my elderly mother who was wanting the ability to read and/or listen to books. After a slow start getting her going (she is not tech savvy) she is really enjoying the versatility of this tablet. Although it does not have cellular data ability, which she had no use for, it gives her the flexibility to connect to wireless networks when she makes her weekly casino visits. Purchased these for Christmas gifts. Assuming they were satisfactory because I didn\\'t hear of need for returning. Purchased as angel tree gifts for preteens. The Kindle Voyage is definitely the way to go. I bought this Kindle to replace my 1st generation Kindle because I wanted a more compact model and the 3G capability this one offers. I am definitely a fan! This item was very easy to use from the very beginning and was very responsive to my request and commands. I like the fact that you can also add other items to work with it Video quality is very good. Works well with Amazon Prime Video and Music - no surprises there. Apps are VERY disappointing - many common apps are not available - even though there are Android versions! Not bad if you have modest expectations. My daughter picked this tablet after her HD Fire battery would no longer work. The insurance kicked in and she picked this one instead of the HD. She wanted more memory for her music does not use it to watch movies really. She loves the blue color and is working just perfect for her. I am extremely happy with my new Kindle Voyage. The text is so sharp and crisp, the images look much better than on the Kindle Paperwhite. The device is extremely light and comfortable to hold, The adaptive front light works great. I have an iPad with the Kindle app, but the reading experience is so much better on my Kindle Voyage that don\\'t regret the purchase one bit. Pricey? Yes... For serious readers and users of library e-books, completly worth it. While nothing beats a real book experience, traveling 4 days plus per week nothing beats the portability and ability to add from the library or Amazon on the fly... Never have to seek out light to read by (a noticeable improvement in the backlight), exceptional direct sun readability, not affected by polarized sunglasses... Great battery life... Great build quality... I expect it to last a long time... Only upgraded as I lost my last kindle on the train. Very easy to set up and use. Really like the screen to view the items searched for, and to read information about the searched item. Bought the Echo Show to add on all my smart wifi appliances, wifi video doorbell, smart TV & sound bar, wifi smart lights, wifi smart thermostat, wifi security camera system and so on. Hey we bought this for our 2 year old grandson and he loves it. Very easy to use and very durable! I bought this for my mom while she was in rehab following shoulder surgery. She loved it. I put several books on it for her and she liked the ease of use, she does not get on the computer and so I needed it to be easy. The Amazon Kindle is light weight and easy to use. This is the right device to play with puzzles, you can avoid samsung/verizon constant advertisements. Only wish the battery would last longer or charge faster. I love that this is a real adult tablet with kids programming installed. Biggest downfall is that my son has trouble switching from app to app, otherwise I\\'d give it 5 stars. The pull up menu eat the bottom isn\\'t very responsive to his little hands. MY DAUTHER LOVES THIS TABLET, IS EXCELLENT FOR A 3 YEARS OLD CHILDREN I got this tablet so I wouldn\\'t have to pack up my laptop when I went to my boyfriend\\'s when I want to do my online class. This is perfect for that A family member has vision problems. They had seen/used the Kindle of another family member - especially the ability to scale text. This device will make it possible to read, which she has had extreme difficulty doing. As I age, it\\'s difficult for me to see the smaller screens so when this one came out .... I was delighted!!! Love playing my games!!! The Echo show screen is great, it is helpful with recipes, music etc. I use it to listen to music all the time. I am hoping someone in my family gets one soon so we can face time each other. This was a surprise when we opened it up! Bright and colorful!! Can\\'t beat the price, it looks and feels nicer than my samsung tablet. I bought this as a gift, but I am thinking about getting one for myself. Works really well with echo and is really neat and fun I like it. Currently it is the only smart system with display. It makes it easier to talk to the device. My only issue with it that it has a slow processor. I looked at multiple other brands, some cheaper by 20-40 bucks. This is the only one that guarantees your kid cant break it for 2 years!!!! Drinks have spilled on it, its been dropped, thrown sat on and not a thing wrong with it. I love my Fire HD8 I got it because my Kindle(the original) that my husband bought me died and the Verizon Tablet wasn\\'t working great for me. So I came down and the agent at store showed me this one, there is a learning curve but it gets better and takes a while to learn but I love it. Echo is nice but it could be better allowing you to connect to anything that is on your WIFI network without having to buy several different hubs. Using for Pandora in an office setting. Set up with older system and speaker system - works great. This was a present for my husband who originally had asked for a radio for his home office. He set it up relatively quick and was amazed at the sound quality. He loved the versatility and that he could have a specific radio station played or a random song as well as tell a joke, etc. It has been fun for all of us and we are looking into getting the smaller \"dots\" for other rooms now. He commented that he would NEVER get rid of this! It\\'s very fun and functional. The Smart bulb is very handy as well. Love it! My nephews love to play with my phone. Now as anyone who has been around small humans knows they have an astounding ability to perpetually have something sticky on their hands. However, if its a rare case where they don\\'t they will probably drop the device from the lack of said stickum. The kindel has come to my rescue as it has everything they need to be entertained. And best of all it lacks the anxiety inducing price tag for that moment when the kids demonstrate Murphy\\'s law in action. this was a christmas present, for the nephew works good, he loves it Bought this for my young granddaughter. It is so easy for her to use. We can control the content. She is learning her colors and alphabet with the help of this tablet. Lots of free content. It was easy to connect to the home wifi. Great battery life. I started with the 7\" little brother and liked it a lot, so I decided to upgrade to the larger model. I use it primarily as an e-reader and for some net surfing and Facebook. The WiFi works great and is ready to access and use. Don\\'t buy this unit if you want cell (4g) access to the Internet. It is WiFi only. Frankly, my cell phone takes better pictures, but that\\'s not what I really wanted from the unit. All in all, a great reader with excellent battery life. While the Fire hd8 tablet certainly will not perform like some of the more expensive units, for basic web surfing, email, and especially shopping on Amazons web site, this tablet performs well, although it will occasionally freeze while surfing some sites. The screen resolution is what I would call \\'adequate\\', but not on par with other high resolution (and far more expensive) tablets out there.Overall, I am pleased with this tablet-so far. good speaker. 8 hour battery. Good price. Excellent quality in how it is made. I purchased two for my grandchildren. They carry the Kindle with them everywhere they go. Great purchase! Verified PurchaseI got the kids version because this is mainly for my toddler. I know, I know, yes I did get this for my toddler. He is always interested in the learning apps we get on our phone for him so we figured this would be perfect. Easy to use and navigate, purchasing books is fast and simple and I love the fact that I can password protect this device My wife and I wanted our children to still enjoy the feeling of having an \"iPad\", so we got the Amazon Fire Kids edition. It has been awesome. I love the way you can set limits on the tablet so they\\'re not glued to it all day long. Kids mode is extremely beneficial. its a nice tablet for the basic uses i need it for such as apple tv and killing time with games. I got this for my 3 year old after he broke my tablet. It is perfect for him! I love that it comes with all the games and apps. He has dropped it several times and no issues. Set up for kids right out of the box. Can\\'t beat Amazon\\'s warranty either. Thanks for providing an outstanding product. Exactly what we wanted from it, something to use the streaming apps when the tv is being used, and want something larger then your phone. Battery lasts days and was great purchase. It works nice. Still seems like ancient techonology compared to any apple product This is a nice bare-bones reading device. Easy to set up and use. My greatest issue is that it isn\\'t back lit so it can\\'t be used w/o a light on in the room. Returning it an purchasing a paperwhite instead. this is excellent for kids 3-7. the only thing I don\\'t like is it is difficult to go to kids web pages by typing in an web address once you set up the kids profile, plus it takes away the easy access of the camera which the kids love. I may have set it up wrong as it did not come with printed instructions and I am not tech savvy. This item is extremely durable and great fun for the kids. Very user friendly and straight forward instructions great for all ages Love the 8 inch HD tablet. Great colors on screen. Not cheaply built like some. It is a perfect gift for kids and great warranty... Love this thing ! I have linked it to my Hue System and my Fire TV. I ask her and she does it. Fun to play games also. My wife was sceptical but now she uses it more than me This is the second one I\\'ve bought for my kids. The each have their own tablet now. As a parent I like that I can set limits...such as screen time, reading, videos etc. You can control everything. It can be educational aswell. Their is alot of educational apps on the device to download. Such as wikipedia,farmers almanac etc. Patents should look through and discover apps with the kids to get full use of the tablet. It continues to update regularly. It doesn\\'t get five stars because there is an issue with the plug in for the charger. It won\\'t plug in all the way it stays loose and comes out. Other than that it\\'s just with my grandson want it he loves it! i just love every thing about it. Its awesome to read This is so far the best Kindle I have ever owned. I love the screen and the resolution on it. The device out performs all of the other e readers on the market. Product works well, and is fun to use. I did a fair amount of research trying to decide between this product and Google\\'s, and the reviews tend to favor the Echo. I have no complaints. We use this as a monitor for the amazon cloud camera! Works great we tell it to show us the camera ,and boom, there‚Äôs the video feed. Super easy to link our echo plus and the echo dot with the show!! I was looking for just a Bluetooth speaker to add to my laptop for better sound. When I first listened to Amazon Tap I was so impressed with the sound quality.....then add in all the features it was a no brainer for a purchase! Sound quality is off the charts, Alexa learns more every day, and so do I! If you are a Prime member, this is a must! If you aren\\'t...then you really should be! Great item, easy to use,would recommend to anybody want to use! Great tablet. Perfect for my 8 year old son!!!!!!!!!!! Works very well. Video quality is very good. It is easy to navigate. Best New Adult Toy in years! Wish I had purchased one for my parents. LOVE IT!!!! I thoroughly enjoy reading on this. That is the main reason I bought it and it fits nicely in my purse. Love it! Really like the camera as my old one was backwards and hard to use. We use Alexa to ask simple questions like - what time is the basketball game? and she usually responds correctly. If you ask a more detailed question, she may not have an answer. We like to play Jeopardy and listen to local radio stations using Alexa. I am sure the device will get better with more use and updates. This was a gift and they love it! Its compact, they can surf the web, play games check emails etc Wanted something with a kids mode on it so we could limit time and content. This works. Saw it for a really low price so couldn\\'t resist otherwise we would have gotten the padded kids version. My son is obsessed with his kids kindle!! A must have so they stay off your phone ! Bought this for my 7 year old so he could play games on those looooooong hockey game car rides -- this tablet was more than enough for what we needed and the app selection is good in the Amazon store! No complaints here! Gave it to my grandkids(ages 3, 4 & 9) for Christmas and they loved it. I\\'m enjoying the ease of having several reading options without the bulk. Easy to use. I would recommend it to anyone whit kids Great sound and functionality. Minimal kinks in programming. Love it for my bedroom. I was worried that it would have lag, but it didn\\'t. I got this to replace my Kindle paperwhite (Which I still LOVE), because I wanted to be able to listen to the audio on the books as well. IT\\'s a great little tablet that does so much of what I wanted it to do. The stand by time and play time are better than I thought they would be as well. I LOVE the blue light filter, although that takes time to get used to it if your not already accustomed to that sort of thing. The only other thing I really don\\'t care for is the fact you can not easily add Google play store. Our 5th Echo Show. We love the Drop In feature, allowing us to use them as an intercom. The ease of playing music on all of them at once throughout the house, and controlled from any device is used daily. The connection to our Sonos system is a real plus. Also connected to our Dish TV receiver. Bought 3 of these for my 4 year old, 6 year old and 9 year old. Perfect for all ages. I love the amazon free time year subscription and the content is very age appropriate. I also love the ability to set the time settings for them. It also works as a regular kindle if you decide not to renew the amazon free time after a year. We love Alexa! Love being able to watch news briefings, seeing the lyrics to songs, and so much more! It\\'s in our kitchen and we use it everyday! Now I can view my front door Ring system as well as all my Arlo cameras. Great products. If you have Echo Spot in each bedroom, you can video talk with your kids by dropping in. Love it This product will for sure come in handy. Very easy to use. Precise,accurate,and knowledgeable. Great tablet for kids they love it it is also great that you can download music and movies through Amazon Prime I love Alexa! Great sound, unlimited music, used the bulb and synchronized it...Simple 2 use.... Great learning tool with extensive amounts of material to use. Accident proof bumper a big plus! My son\\'s love there tablet. Great but for the price It takes a little getting used to if you are used to Android Still figuring out what all I can do with it but the Echo was extremely easy to hook up. The instructions that came with it made everything very clear. The speaker doesnt get room filling loud if you want to play music but thankfully it has an audio out jack so I just hooked it up to some speakers. Perfect for development if you use the parental controls properly by setting time limits, goals for reading vs. game play, etc.Durable, reliable, perfect for when you need a few minutes of quiet time. Charger provided was flimsy, but any mini-USB works better. I bought this as a gift. As far as know it works fine It is great if you are a prime member , case is durable! We love it to control the whole house lighting with Phillips Hue bulbs, as well as just everyday use for alarms, reminders, questions, news and even adjusting A/C, and Pandora Music Playlists. Bought one for my family as well. This is really good if you read a lot, doesn\\'t strain your eyes and very light weight. Only demerit is - cant use in night if there is not enough light. Wish it had its own onternet connection but other than that great purchase To use. Putting in after Christmas. Want all lights on voice activation. No real upgrades to the iPhone 7 from the 6. There is no learning curve for sure. However the camera is better and that is a plus. Blue is beautiful & allows grand-daughter to be able to tell which one is hers. Loves the piano program and challenging herself to play as much of the song as she can. Nice size for traveling with. Granddaughter loves it, easy for a toddler to hold and maneuver. Purchased these for my grandkids...and they absolutely love them. They can play play their games to their hearts\\' content. They ar ed really fast too. It\\'s not a very powerful tablet. I needed something just to view Netflix and some other videos. Not to mention play some music and look at photos. Other than that I think it\\'s too weak, not good for gaming. For the price though, you can\\'t beat it. Have yet to explore all the aspects. Enjoy using it daily. I bought this tablet to replace my textbook. It has everything I want and need. I only purchased it after I learned you can download from google play. The amazon equivalent to google play has a lot of the same apps and games. Great for kids if you don\\'t want to spend money on the IPAD. Grandson was so happy & pleased with the Fire tablet. He was able to download & start playing within minutes of purchase. Would buy another if the need existed. Great product will recommend it to friends and family. I bought the echo plus that is supposed to come with a Phillips Hue light bulb. I got the echo plus but no light bulb. I contacted Elite Plus and after a very long go around was told I would get a $20 credit on the best buy gift card that I used as part of the payment. I was told it would take up to 15 days to get the credit (why so long). I was also told I would get an email stating info about the credit. I still have not gotten the email. I have my doubts if I will ever see the $20 put back on my gift card. This is the second time I have ordered a bundle from Best Buy online and have received the main item but not the bundled items. Last year I bought a friend a PS4 bundle for XMas. They got the PS4 but none of the included games. I had to call and get the games sent out separately. I don\\'t know what is the problem is with their online ordering when bundled items are included. I am getting very wary of ordering anything online with Best Buy that I will get what I ordered on time. BTW... I really like the Echo Plus. Just not the screw up with the shipping and the initial solution I was offered when I called customer service. The parental controls are amazing! Super easy for my daughter to operate This was a replacement for another fire. It\\'s the best tablet we\\'ve had and does everything we need it to. my dauther loves the tablet and I can get the SD to get more storage and load up all the disney movies that I purchased. it is a great purchase. I‚Äôm in love with Alexa. Love her fir music, quick weather updates and in the kitchen for recipes. It‚Äôs great getting them step by step and not having to keep putting the passcode in on my iPad with hands covered in flour. I am satisfied with this purchase, I can see my family now without doing tango, Skype & etc.. We can have different phones from iOS and android to see each other and it‚Äôs very clear thanks Amazon...... Better and faster than Kindle 7\". Great performance for the price. My wife and kids love it. Easy to use. Great for the price. We bought this for our toddlers, and so far seems to hold up well with them. Some quirky rules with Amazon and accounts with product, but overall good for what we need. We all love ALEXA! You can play games like Jeopardy or would you rather family edition. The kids love to have Alexa tell them jokes. Good little tablet for media. Lack of built in Google apps is annoying but can be bypassed without rooting. There\\'s different things my daughter can do,on it, plus I can read on it as well. So very happy with the new kindle ! I highly recommend this product ! Not sure. It was a gift. We\\'ll be setting up after Christmas A gift to my 2 year old granddaughter. It came preloaded with child programs. She quickly learned how to access the programs. Parents now have their iPad back...very well protected for tosses and drops I bought this and onother one in blue. The kids love it. Great product for myself! And I bought it when there was great deal on it! I highly recommend this tablet for a toddler. There are plenty of learning activities that engage little minds. The case that comes with it is sturdy, my toddler drops/throws this tablet and it\\'s not damaged at all. Love my kindle ! I enjoy reading everyday and I can easily throw in my bag with out it adding any weight . Got this tablet for my mother and liked it so much that I went and got one for myself! It runs fast for what I use it for! Got this for my Daughter-in-Law and she loves it. Does exactly what she needs it to do. It was great and great for the kids and adults thanks Tablets are excellent for Youth Sunday School class. great for listening to prime music, quick weather reports. volume adjusts quickly and gives status of battery on request. big screen,2 year old granddaughter watches Sesame Street and scrolls through selections.... Have not used the product. This item was a gift and I have not yet received word on the product. I am really enjoying it !! Love it ! Sales person was also great Good tablet for young kids. Battery life could be better If you‚Äôre lik me and trying to update your home into a smart home, this is a must need. I have by my bed side and am able to see the front door I have been enjoying the amazon tap for two weeks, and am still finding new things it will do Pretty good sound for the size and configuration of speaker. Easy to set up. love all the fun things you can do with Alexa. And she\\'s learning more everyday! Alexa is easily confused and fun to mess with but also informative when we are being serious. She disappoints when she loses connection with the wifi; but it\\'s not often. We have 6 different Alexa products and after a few hiccups; all are working well. Impressed. I have had many tablets, Samsung, Asus and old Ipad. This Fire holds its own . The Silk system is not quite as speedy but the lack of bloatware is nice. There is a hack to get more google apps. It\\'s light to hold, the ads are not invasive. I enjoy taking advantage of the Prime benefits. Simple to operate. Would recommend for everyday use and movie/reading music consumption. Great tablet with a lot of features. Great price too. WORTH IT I LOVED WELL INVESTED MONEY. ALEXA HELPING ME A LOT, REMINDERS, LISTEN TO MUSIC AND MAKING MY HOUSE SMARTER, SIMPLY AND EASY, NO REGRETS:-) Easy to use with great picture. I would recommend it to a friend. I have put this in the kitchen to use for recipes and controlling various devices. For the money I highly recommended it. It is great when linked to Netflix, Disney Movies, etc Gave as a gift to niece in hospital she loved it. Was able to do everything on the tablet she wanted to. Easy to use I was the one who set it up for her was very simple. this is the best tablet out there.....great bang for your buck This was a Christmas present. The person that received it was very happy with it.. She has other Kindles but this new one is an obvious improvement over the previous ones. My daughter loves this tablet. She drops it and it keeps going. she can\\'t put it down. We love this , so many apps that you can download for free easy to maneuver she will be able to grow with this Santa brought this to our daughter, she\\'s 7 and it\\'s perfect for her!! Easy to use and figure out! WAS LOOKING FOR A NEW TABLET. .. GREAT PRICE FOR THIS ONE! Decent sounding music device...easy to connect and use the app. Getting custom routines set up with smart home (vivint, hue, etc) takes some trial and error figuring out commands. Would buy again. works great, easy to use. play videos and game good the back light nad easier to read in all lightings I love this little speaker. It is small enough to carry it wherever I want to bring it yet loud enough to be heard The Alexa interface is pretty cool as well. The only issue for me is that it doesn\\'t connect with Apple Music. This issue is easily resolved by putting Tap in Bluetooth mode and playing Apple Music through my phone to the Tap This is my third Kindle, I still have the other two; however, this has a camera and much larger screen. I would take this product any day over a tablet. Have several echo\\'s throughout the house and bought the Echo Tap so I could move it when I need to move around from the garage to outdside. Mainly listen to music and has worked well. Have noticed that I usually have to yell for Alexa to hear me but that may have to do with the acoustics in the garage. Other than that it works well. You can play trivia with your family and learn a lot about the world I can use my tablet all time and your conecctions is very good I bought this device recently for my daughter, she likes it very much. She learning new things. I also gifted this device to my friends Son. This product is significantly improved over my previously owned first generation Kindle and first generation Fire. The resolution is better, the programmable features are more numerous and the response is quicker. This is my 2nd tablet and it works great with downloading Speaker was used as a giveaway and everyone wanted it! It was a huge hit at our conference. Would buy again. Awseome tablet for toddler. I would recommend this tablet for all age groups. Works great with my amazon prime account and for browsing Internet and playing game. Cheap tablet as well. This tablet is great for my son. Would be nice if it had a little more horsepower Alexa turns on the lights and when I say ‚Äú Alexa good night‚Äù she turns them off. Love her! The Show sounds significantly better than the echo plus. And the added screen features are nice. I just wish the ‚Äúthings to try section‚Äù would go away Am happy with my purchase and the item is being used by my brother\\'s son and he is also happy as on dat Great tablet for beginners! Very light and screen is wide. Enjoy using for travels. We use echo almost every day. It is fun to ask questions. The music is great. We check the weather and listen to NPRnews Bought it for the grandkids for Christmas. Like the parental controls! Good choice for the price, good performance, and fast. So read reviews on a few tablets but honeatly felt this was the one for my kids bought it and sure enough it was it best apps for kids especially reading for kids amazon did a good deal on this and if you have prime it links up with your account for videos too Great customer service at Best Buy I was able to navigate through the product before actually purchasing it I will def be back and highly recommend it Helps keep my son entertained on long rides, and it\\'s pretty indestructible. This is a great way to read books on the go. There\\'s no backlight, so reading in darker rooms may be hard. But it\\'s affordable and portable and a great way to take all your books with you. The Fire HD 8 is the perfect size EReader. Big enough to see the text but small enough to hold comfortably. Purchased this for my 80 year old mother in law to replace her old cracked screen one. Everything was perfect easy to use and set up. She has zero problems using this for online and reading books. I have two Echo Dots and wanted something that was more portable for other times when I\\'m not near those two devices in my home. I also needed a speaker so I thought I\\'d try the Echo Tap. You can choose to just press it to activate or you can enable hands-free and it will respond just like my Echo Dot does. The sound is amazing out of this little thing. I love the charging dock. No dealing with trying to plug it in... just sit it down on the charging dock and you\\'re good. Give this product a 10 tons of great learning programs. I bought this with paper white and didn‚Äôt see much of a difference in terms of resolution and use. I totally recommend this reader as it‚Äôs so small and powerful! I love having Alexa in my home. Alexa has helped from recipes to relaxing sleep sounds all night I was contemplating to buy either the insignia 10.1 or the Fire Hd8, I\\'m so glad I chose the latter. It is so fast and sufficient for my needs. I also downloaded Google play on the tablet even making this a better purchase. For $59, you can\\'t go wrong with this purchase. I would recommend this Prouducts it had great full sound full sound with a conpack This is a great product at a great price I would definitely recommend this to anybody especially good for college students or people that read books etc. Bought this so the grandkids could use it. They already have one at their house. My husband has been using it also & he likes it. He has never used a tablet before but he has enjoyed it. my grandson-8-loves this --the games and the books! No complaints easy and extremely fun to use. Alexa can do it all Good, able to read under bright sunlight conditions too Good tablet for kids I would definitely recommend. My granddaughter loves it! Long battery and is tough.She loves all the games and she learning so muchEveryday. This is my first Fire Kindle. I love it. It is fast, and has good internet. It gives me quick access to all my Kindle library. I found out it\\'s easier to scroll through the pages than when using Kindle Touch. This amazon echo is most likely the best way to go! Great product, answers all your questions and controls compatible devices Works great and we like like the light that came with it., Not one issues so far! Excellent lightweight way to take a lot of reading materials along when traveling. This is my 4th kindle and is easily the best one I\\'ve ever had. It is very comfortable to hold and is very compact. I was surprised how small it is but has the same screen size as my other kindles. It may look costly at first but remember you are getting a cover with additional battery. Got this tablet for my spouse who has never had one before and it\\'s perfect for him! Tends to flip out of my screen to something else. Each screen change = at least one pop up ad. Otherwise, it\\'s been reliable so far. I like the looks of the Echo Plus and the sound from the speakers is something I didn‚Äôt expect to be as nice as it is. I‚Äôm using it to tune into my favorite radio station, answer any question I have to look up on the internet and assist me with lighting. I am considering another for a different room. This Alexa is the best one out of all them due to the screen feature This is the 3rd one I\\'ve purchased. I\\'ve bought one for all of my nieces. No other case compares to this one. It has held protected the tablet so many times from them dropping it. I have one, purchased this one for my mother in law, she had a 7 inch, between the bigger screen and HD, this one is much easier on her eyes and she can use it for longer periods of time without her eyes bothering her. Love this product. It is nice looking, easy to carry, and the sound is amazing. Very easy to set up and connect to amazon echo. Nothing to complain about th he speaker itself. However the carrying case is kind of stupid and useless also. One has to take it down just in order to charge. i mainly purchased this so my child can have access to amazon undergrond to get free apps. he normally uses an ipad . i can tell this is slower but i was not looking for ipad quality. it gets the job done This was an upgrade purchase. My previous Kindle was 4 years old. (still working!) This new version is so much faster and has a much better quality camera! Love it for reading, Netflix and on-line shopping! Purchased the Echo Plus because of the built in Zigbee hub. It controls my Philips Hue bulbs throughout the house. very easy setup. Speaker is sufficient for the area I have it in. bought as a gift for my daughter. actually sounds better and easier to set up than expected. the personal assistant feature is really amazing, instant response to requests for information and music. Works great, looks great, readable in bright sun... My new Echo Plus exceeds my expectations. The speaker\\'s sound is just what I wanted and the included Hue bulb is great. This is one of Good item bought for my 2017 Thanksgiving deals Perfect for my son! He has fine motor deficits and the games definitely help him work on using one finger at a time to play them! I also don\\'t have to worry about him getting onto anything that isn\\'t kid friendly since he doesn\\'t know my passcode for the adult profile!! Functionality and ease of use are outstanding right out of the the box. Super clear screen and weight is minimum and is a joy to use. Bought the Echo Tap, Echo Dot, Phillips Hue Starter Kit and a Honeywell Thermostat for my wife for her birthday.She loves it and so do I!Cant wait to add more automated products to it. No need to have my phone out fumbling through multiple apps to change lighting and temperature, check weather, play music, etc., I just ask Alexa to do it while I continue at what I\\'m doing.Also, when the Dot and Tap are in the same room, the one that is closest to you typically answers your requests. Nice device that will only improve with time. This works well, charges book readers quickly and easily I am pleasantly surprised at how well this works. I bought the e reader and it didn\\'t work so I was nervous buying this kindle. But it works great and my son loves it! This is a great way to begin making your home a smart home. Easy to set up, built in hub, easy to use. Alexa rocks. The Echo Plus is super easy to set up. I works great. Love everything about it. Adding more devices. I bought this as a cheap alternative to an old, slow, iPad 2, until I could spring for the iPad Pro. Got it as a Black Friday deal, so it was more than worth it. Was able to add some missing apps that make it even better than I thought it could be, and having Amazon Prime makes it an inexpensive and handy media device. I carry it in my bag at all times without having to worry about it\\'s value. Can\\'t beat it for the price. My fiance really enjoyes it! I would definitely recommend. Got this laptop for an in-bound college student. Best option that I found. Great for little kids the case on it is amazing. My daughter loves it. Only thing I would change is the sound a little louder and screen a little bigger. Needed a tough little tablet for my grandson. Had it a couple of months and has held up very well. This tablet is really good for the price, especially on the holidays. If you are a movie watcher or just using it for games it has great speed with a quad core. Highly recommend so e-book as well. Very happy with my purchase I bought 3 already. I love this tablet. I purchased them for gift and am so glad I did! Limit kids usage of electronics by time but still allow them to play. A must buy for kids It is perfect as a secondary tablet for my son to take on the road. Love it. So easy to use. I previously had a Nook Color, but since the newest Nook was having problems getting library books at the time I decided to go with Kindle. Worried I would lose the Nook books I had purchased over the years. Nope not a problem. Just had to download a couple of apps. m.getjar.com to download 3rd party apps. Once that is downloaded, open m.getjar and find Nook there. Easy peasy. I love this tablet. One of the best out there on the market. Very satisfied with product as do my family /kids. I\\'ve had lots of tablets in the past, mostly from the Samsung line, but this is my first Amazon Fire, so I want to write this review for others who have never tried one of these. At the time that this was written, Alexa had not been added to the tablet.First, while this device runs an Android type of operating system, Amazon puts its own spin on the operating system. I don\\'t feel like I\\'m using Android. This feels different to me. It doesn\\'t have the same level of customization that Android users have come to appreciate. That being said, if you are an Amazon Prime member, this device has been tailored to be your content entertainment machine. It\\'s simply a fun way to consume your magazines, books, etc.There are 3 on-screen buttons on the bottom of the device. The middle button immediately takes you to your home screen. The button to the left acts as a sort of \"back\" button. It also lets me get rid of my keyboard when I don\\'t need it on screen, but it\\'s open. The button to the right is super important. It took me a couple of days to realize what it does. That square shaped button is what you press you see what apps you have open. It lets you switch between apps, but it also lets you see which apps you have open and close them out. You can close them by pressing the \"X\" button in the corner of the window that appears or by touching the app window and swiping to the right. If you leave all of those apps open and you never close them, you\\'ll drain your battery. Make sure you use that little square button to clear your apps.The device has several menus that you swipe left to view. First, you start with your home screen. You literally can stay on this screen and do anything you need to do on the tablet. All of your apps are housed here. You swipe up to view all of them. The tablet comes with several apps pre-installed such as Slik, Amazon\\'s own internet browser, Audible, Good Reads, the Amazon app store, a weather app, etc. You can go to the Amazon app store to download other apps such as Twitter, Facebook, etc. You can combine the apps on this page into folders. You just drag one app to another app and a folder appears. This made my home screen much more manageable. You can change the size of the font on the home screen from normal to large or small in the device settings. This feature doesn\\'t necessarily increase the size of the font within your apps, however. I believe it only changes the font on your main screens.If you have a magazine or newspaper subscription that is connected to your device, when you have a new issues, it will show up at the top of your home page screen under the heading of \"new items.\" The device comes with a free 6 month subscription to the Washington Post. You\\'ll see that under \"new items\" when you initially activate your tablet.You can change the wallpaper on the screen to use one of your own photos. You can do this through the settings menu on the device. If you want to use one of your own photos, however, you need to either take it on the device or move it into Amazon\\'s Photos app, which is a cloud-based app.So far, I haven\\'t found a way to effectively use a different photo management app that will let me change my wallpaper. I\\'m not crazy about the Amazon Photo app. I found it annoying to move my photos from my phone into Amazon\\'s cloud just so I could view them on my tablet. That being said, I\\'m not planning to take photos on this device. I just wanted a few pet photos on there and the ability to change my wallpaper.Beyond the home screen, you can swipe to the right to view your other screen. They are pre-arranged to be: books, videos, games, shop, apps, music, audiobooks, and newstand. All of those screens are connected to your Amazon account. For example, if you have Kindle books you\\'ve already purchased, they automatically will appear under the Books menu. Your magazines and newspaper subscriptions will appear under the newstand menu. There doesn\\'t seem to be a way to change the order of the menu pages. That bugs me, but it\\'s not the end of the world. There\\'s also one menu to the left of the \"home\" menu. It\\'s the \"recent\" page. It shows you what you\\'ve received looked at on the tablet. I never use it, but it might be handy for some people.One of my favorite features of this tablet is Amazon\\'s \"On Deck\" capability. If you\\'re an Amazon Prime member, Amazon will periodically download a video to your device that it thinks you might like. The items don\\'t count against your pre-installed memory and they automatically deleted off if your memory starts getting full. You can turn off the \"on deck\" feature if you don\\'t like it. I\\'ve been content with the video playback capability. This isn\\'t my major use of the device, but the images look fine and the audio is OK. I\\'ll talk more about the speakers later. My other favorite feature of this tablet is viewing magazine content through the Newstand. I\\'ve tried 3 magazines on here and they all look gorgeous. Now, I can always have my magazines with me so if I\\'m stuck at the airport or at the doctor\\'s office, I always have them. One of my regular magazines includes a free digital version of the magazine for free. I just had to connect my account to the device. This allows me to download the back issues of the magazine for as long as I\\'ve had an account. My other magazine didn\\'t include a digital edition so I canceled the print edition of it and switched to the digital version. (It was an inexpensive magazine, anyway.) There are several magazines that you can try free for 30 days on the device. I did this with a third magazine and decided to keep it for a year. Viewing magazines on this gadget is a pleasure.The Kindle Fire doesn\\'t come with the Google Play store installed. You can side load it to the device without rooting it (and breaking your warranty.) You can Google to find the instructions to do this. It\\'s not difficult to do if you\\'re fairly comfortable with technology. It probably took me 10 minutes. Most of the apps I wanted were in the Amazon store, but there were a handful that I had paid for through Google Play. The only way I could have them was to go back to access that store. They have worked fine so far. I despise the keyboard that Amazon pre-installed on this device. There are no lines between the letters on the keyboard. I suppose it designed to be better for swyping through keys, but I hate it. I fixed that problem by going to Google Play and downloading a new keyboard. It was a pretty easy problem to solve so I can\\'t complain.Apps that are connecting to the Internet can be a little slow to load on this device compared to my other gadgets, but that generally doesn\\'t bother me. If you were using this tablet to replace your personal laptop, however, that might drive you crazy. The screen on this device isn\\'t bad. If I compare it to my fancy phone, it\\'s not as shape, but when you think about the price of this device compared to my smartphone, the screen is outstanding.The speakers are OK. There are two of them located on the bottom of the screen. I won\\'t say that they are fantastic. They aren\\'t. In my opinion, they are fine for watching YouTube or a television show. They are not OK for listening to music if you are an audiophile. You can make it a little better by downloading a different music app instead of relying on the pre-install app, but still your music will sound tinny. That being said, you can always connect your tablet to a bluetooth speaker, use a pair of headphones, etc.This device wasn\\'t made for taking pictures. It has a front and back camera, but they aren\\'t designed to be spectacular. I\\'m not using them.I find this device a little difficult to hold in my hands. I think that\\'s partly because of the size and partly because it feels very slick. Also, I do have some hand problems (similar to someone who has Carpal Tunnel syndrome). I think it will be easier to handle once my case arrives. I\\'m still waiting for it. I\\'m greatly enjoying this device. It\\'s simply fun to use the tablet. There are weaknesses that come with that lower price tag, but you legitimately get a lot of bang for your buck, particularly if you regularly use Amazon services. If you don\\'t typically use Amazon and you are just looking for a tablet for viewing the Internet and you\\'re looking for a low price tag, this device may be OK for you. I bought this tablet because it was very inexpensive and the right size and fit for my daughter... Nice tablet for media consumption for the price. For Amazon user for sure I bought my Kindle about 2 months ago and the battery is already dead and will not charge I purchased this as a replacement for my older Kindle. It is excellent as always but I also noticed very little new features or updates since my last Kindle model. Would have liked some more design, form factor, or feature changes. That being said, it fits the bill and is amazingly light, so I have no other complaints. My Grandma likes it a lot. For the basic book reader nothing beats it for the money. Love my new Kindle fire. This replaces my old one and is just as good. Videos are as good as my tv with cable. Well with every penny spent and better deal than when I tried Amazon. I love my new e-reader!! I am enjoying all my books in one place. Love my new kindle, thought the screen would be too large but after using it a few days, all is good. Very thin , got a case for it, I now feel at home with it. Do not like the \"new\" lock screen lock to open the tablet at all, its tiny and hard to \"unlock\" most always taking several times to swipe it just right. Very good value tablet. Does everything pretty well. Brightness isn\\'t great. Battery takes a while to charge but lasts forever. Decent buy. Would recommend. Great table does everything that i need it for. Great resolution and screen for reading books Bought this for my wife. She is a constant reader and put away her previous Kindles for this one. She now has internet access also, so she can find more books anytime she wants. This is my first Fire Kindle. I love it. It is fast, and has good internet. It gives me quick access to all my Kindle library. I found out it\\'s easier to scroll through the pages than when using Kindle Touch. I purchased this tablet for my 3 year old and he loves it! Very easy to use and setup. I got this for my mother as a gift. She absolutely loves it. She was wanting a small, cheap tablet and this fit her needs. Can\\'t beat the value on this. 5 stars even though it has less apps than the play store. Great gift easy to use and she loves being able to take it anywhere They learned how to use it very quickly! Great for travelling in the car...reduces boredom! Use a lot of home automation and this is a great addtion. If you are not an Alexa or home automation fan I would recomend trying to catch this on sale, you may not need the screen a much as you think. The sound quality is great. I love having this in my kitchen, it has replaced my ipad that i used to use. I purchased it to control my lights & introduce myself to Alexa & AI, but I find myself using it for all sorts of things and enjoy using it. I can now control my front door Arlo camera by asking Alexa to show the live feed in to my TV, and get my Robots vacuum cleaner to start work , plus listen to the latest weather conditions & do my normal google search via Alexa . I am seriously hooked in to my Alexa!!!! I normally read my ebooks on my phone but my son beoke his tablet and so I gave him mine and bought a kindle for myself. I must say that I cant put it down i love it so much. This was a Black Friday special and we knew we wanted a smart home assistant and Alexa worked well with the Ring doorbell system. There are times when you have to ask her the same thing over and over until she figures it out but overall it was a food deal. Great for kids. Simple and inexpensive. 16G must better than 8G Works great ! Geating this one for my grandson for Christmas! He plays with his sisters now ! Well protected when they drop them ! Great learning experience ! we bought this as a gift for our son. he is absolutely loving it. Gave this to my wife for Christmas to replace her well used first generation kindle. She loves it. does everything our other tablets do and more. Like the sharing across platforms. I bought the echo after seeing it demonstrated by my brother. He proceeded to ask Alexa questions and Alexa would answer them immediately. He then asked it to pull up some songs which, it did right away. Then he asked it to call mom and it did that as well. Needless to say, i had to get one. Fun item and helpful to do things around the home. Nice starter tablet for my nephew. Does what we need it to do. very durable and easy to work with. I love its functionality and my kid loves having his own tablet. good stuff my grandchild really enjoy playing and watch videos on her Kindle I am really enjoying my new kindle fire hd 8. The picture is awesome even for a movie. I use it mostly to read with an occasional game or movie too. Colors are great and the size of the screen is very nice. I have a 7 inch fire and there is enough size difference for movies etc to make it worthwhile. Plus there was a great black Friday price. This is the 4th tablet I have bought for my 10-year-old son over the past few years. He is just rough with the. I made sure to purchase the rubber cover and I am set. There is plenty of space on the tablet for him to keep the fun apps that he likes. He is managing well with it. Glad I purchased it. Definitely easy on the eyes for long reading sessions, especially when compared to the LCD screens of smart phones and tablets. The only issues we had were that it drops the connection to our WiFi network and then won\\'t connect to the Kindle store. I don\\'t think it\\'s an issue with my network since all our other devices don\\'t have the connectivity issues we had with this. My first Alexa product and I‚Äôm going to say I‚Äôve had her for about a month and I love it have it hooked up with my Phillips hue lights works awesome It\\'s a good starter tablet, to bad it runs on the Amazon OS. I take 1 star off, because I had problems to syncing it with my W-FI. The Echo show with video screen is a nice upgrade to the other echo‚Äôs. News briefs with videos are nice. Very good sound quality for playing music. I really purchased this for my wife to use as a Bluetooth speaker knowing that maybe we would find something else for it to do. I\\'m glad I did, now. We have Christmas tree lights going off and on, lamps dimming at precise measures, \"Alexa, light 30 percent\", and am looking at the other many, many things that this can do. It\\'s easy to setup, too. My 4 year old son got this for Christmas and he loves it It works great and is easy too use. The salesman was a tremendous help. I am very pleased with this purchase. It is lightweight and the smaller size enables me to carry it easily. This Kindle allows me to read out in the sun without any glare. The only suggested improvement would be a lighted display to enable reading at night. I love my new toy. Alexa is my personal girl Friday. She understands what I want and retrieves it. Easy to set up and use. Echo plus is able to play music and response whatever answer by itself. It also equip with bluetooth so I can pair to another more powerful speaker. It\\'s so convenient to ask/request without touch anything. The response time is acceptable but you need to speak out your question right after calling Alex or it won\\'t wait. I would highly recommend this kindle. It is user friendly and not to big. But large enough to see easily The kid really love this kindle fire. The protection for the kindle help protect the kindle I have already got 2 from Best Buy before this is my third one This Kindle doesn\\'t have a lighted screen like the pricier models but it has a higher dpi screen than the lower model. It\\'s exactly what I needed, nothing more, nothing less. I\\'ve had no problems with the reader at all so far so I\\'ll give it 5 stars. Alexa usually works well but it has turned on things when I did not tell it to. I already had a Fire but it didn\\'t have enough storage space. This tablet solved that problem for me. However I\\'m unable to download Dropbox because it is already installed on my previous tablet and this tablet is a little different. I did however figure out that I could install One Drive and then put my photos into that program. Otherwise it is a good tablet. This Kindle is a convenient size yet lettering is easy to read. Lots of good features for the Amazon member. Tablet is nice and fast. Not going to lie - we haven‚Äôt even opened it yet. Planning on getting it all setup tomorrow night. I did see it at the store though & it was incredible Very easy to handle. many books to choose from and very convenient Great learning tool. Kids love it and so do I. So fun to share time with the kids laughing while learning. This camera is a great addition to my home I really like it You can take everywhere your music and with wifi you are connected with the world. The best is that the battery lasts a long time. Just what I was looking for. Needed a book that I could take on a vacation I bought this fire for my 7 year old and she loves it. The amazon fire OS is not a perfect OS but it is very functional and useful for your average tablet use. I would recommend checking the Amazon store to ensure the Apps you are thinking of using on a Fire tablet to ensure you dont have any issues. The size on this one is good, the screen is not the brightest HD screen that is available, but at this price point i cannot complain. I bought this for my kids its a cheap alternative to an Ipad mini and should they lose it or break it its easy to replace with little out of pocket. she loves it she is 6yrs old and it fits her level well and she just loves it This tablet was a gift for my father-in-law and is his first tablet ever. He is really enjoying getting to know his way around it. It\\'s definitely user friendly and perfect for reading, music, and things like that! The Kindle is great! It\\'s easy to set up and I\\'ve found all the books that I wanted. Great for kids. Simple and inexpensive. 16G must better than 8G these tablets work wonders for my needs, i didnt need a tablet to work, only for web browsing and play some games. nothing fancy, this tablet fits perfectly for that. and the price...pff perfect. ! you wont find this quality cheaper. I like the video feature for my doorbell. Wish it automatically showed a picture when door bell rung. Does not FaceTime. Maybe later. Also not all cameras are compatible. We love our Amazon Echo but it is hard wired to kitchen. Because of where we live AM reception is poor but through an Echo or Amazon Tap I can listen to some of my favorite stations through iHeart Radio and the Tap is portable. We bought this for our 3 year old daughter. Great variety of apps, books, and educational videos for her to explore. Love the features that allow us to control her time spent on it. My only complaint is that its processing speed is quite slow getting between different menus but at this price and for a 3-year old I can\\'t complain too much. Purchased this tablet for my two year old son. It is easy for him to use and has been surprisingly durable. Would recommend the replacement plan if purchasing for a child. Nice starter tablet for my nephew. Does what we need it to do. This is a good size tablet! It is fast and responsive. Great buy for the money, no complaints. Highly recommended. I had to ask for help because they don\\'t keep this model on display, it\\'s \"behind the counter\". But other than that, in-store was a breeze. And the product exceeds my expectations. Although, it would be even better if it was waterproof--- but it does perfectly fit into a medium baggie. Bought this for my son and one for my husband and me. So easy to set up. Very helpful. Doesn‚Äôt take up a lot of space. The best product I have used for AI. Easy set up and easy to use. Item work well and was easy to read from in day light Works well for browsing and reading. It also has great apps. Perfect device for my kids. Easy to use with lots of features. I bought this for my granddaughter who is 2 and was able to load all the apps and books as well as her Disney movies. So far she has been unable to access anything that I don\\'t want her to. And it has been able to withstand frequent toddler abuse.. Aka.. Throwing it. Definitely recommend. No suprises here. I have owned the 7th generation Kindle before and the 8th generation came as a lighter and better upgrade to the version. Great functionality and awesome reading experience. I bought this for my son. He been reading books and searching stuff on line and watching youtube on it. He said it didn\\'t hurt his eyes like the iPad. Enjoying my Tap, asking Alexa questions, and the small form factor makes it easy to take along while traveling. Decent battery life and sound for such a small speaker. Only reason I didn\\'t give 5 stars, was the difficulty in connecting the Tap to public wifi\\'s such as hotels, in my situation...takes some effort. I bought this tab as a birthday gift for my 12 yr old nephew who lives in India. It\\'s very useful for him to google for important information over the Internet for his school assignments. Also, he can video chat with me using Skype.Rightly priced to be a kid\\'s product. Resolution could\\'ve been better if its targeted as a kid\\'s product. I think better resolution can reduce some pressure on eyes while reading documents with fine text. The echo is easy to use and fun to use once you buy one you\\'ll want them for all over your house. i love the addition of my echo show to my other Alexa devices. Having the screen to read recipes and viiew notes is great! It was a gift and she really loved it. It was an in-store service clerk that educated me on this product.. Love this tablet easy to use and extremely affordable The product was fine. I would definitely recommended to a friend. I got the Amazon - Fire - 7 - Tablet - 16GB - Blue for my 9 year old granddaughter. It is user friendly and she is able to navigate and use the tablet with ease. It is a great tool for her in school work since there are numerous apps. she is able to use for multiplication and division facts. A great product! had a problem with my purchase, but Best Buy made it good, they are very good! Purchased this for a gift for my mother who is a amazon fanatic she loves it ! Made her christmas this year The echo show works very well with Bluetooth and WiFi. Great sound and screen. Recommend to anyone The kindle is great not only is it a reader its bascially a computer. It connects to the internet it takes pictures and has many other great features. Item work well and was easy to read from in day light I bought this primarily to be used as a Kindle eReader and this is a good product for this cost.. The only drawback is that I cannot access all the apps available on the Google PlayStore and have to be content with what is available on the Amazon app store. My Son absolutely loves this thing, very durable and comes with a great warranty. This tablet is the perfect size and so easy to use. Read, play games or any other purpose--it is great! very pleased with my amazon tablet. starting with the price ,ease of use, and size. It does everything I need a table to do. And it is really fast.. This is a great tablet for the price! Love the pink color! I\\'m using it to keep track of my tools using the Sails app. it is great for this. The only flaw I see is that the display is insensitive to using a pen. My touch is much better. I was hoping to use the pen since when I access it, I may have dirty fingers after using my tools. just bought. seems to be working great so far. not sure how long it will last. I have no idea how my family ever lived without these products! Since purchasing the Alexa Hub and Hue bulb, we\\'ve purchased Echo Dots for our kitchen and son\\'s room. We absolutely love the convenience of the bulbs and Alexa is a life saver on so many levels. This is my second Kindle and I love it. It\\'s lightweight, simple, and fast. It\\'s convenient for trips and fits in my bag without weighing it down. This little sorcerer\\'s box displays magical pictures and bright pretty colors. Got this for my Daughter-in-Law and she loves it. Does exactly what she needs it to do. Love Alexa and all of its features. Love that I can listen to music and read ebooks Good tablet for my daughter! She loves it ,but she gets annoyed how the battery runs out quickly! My kids like to play music, I like the online rafio and weather service. Very easy to use and love the graphics of the screen. Initially we purchased the Kids Kindle Fire for our 3 year old. The parental controls and time limitations are super easy to set up. We have a Samsung Galaxy tablet that our 9 year old son uses, but we ended up getting a second Fire for him because it seemed very kid-friendly and I didn\\'t have to worry about any inappropriate content popping up. Lots of good educational apps and games. Love how the echo show integrates with smart house devices and cameras. I use it to view our cameras, listen to music, make phone calls/video calls and even as a recipe guide when cooking. I‚Äôve been very impressed! I love my Amazon Fire tablet it does exactly what I needed to do. Alexa is there to answer those questions you do not have an answer for along with news and weather I already the Echo Dot and saw Amazon advertising for the new show over the summer. Got it as a gift and personally I love it. The speakers and sound from it are great. Plays the lyrics for any songs you have going, so you can karaoke without sucking now. Also displays the time, since I got rid of cable and no longer have that it is nice to have a clock in the living room. Very easy to interact with! love the first now a new one. everything at your fingertips. Very good price for the product. Sounds good and fun and easy to set up. I love my Echo Show! Easy to set up! And fun to use!! I bought this for my grandson who loves it. Easy to understand and lots of great apps to download. Forget the iPad - buy this instead and get the same functionality for way less money Love the echo show. Nice to have a visual. Love the drop in feature! I really like how she is able to interact and plays music with great sound. She interacts with my smart home. Seriously a flawless, portable, smart, multipurpose gadget. Add this to the incredible Flash Sale price and I\\'d have been a fool to pass it up. Fast charge, balanced tuning, easy to pair and did I mention highly portable? The cradle is a sweet design too. The only beef I have is that YOUR BLUETOOTH IS PAIRED screaming at you when syncing. Own one of these- It needs the Internet to connect to your devices and play music. Sometimes you can be cut off. The rest of the time it is easy as can be. Grandson used a borrowed one at school. So now has his own . Eco plus is an amazing product, it integrates with most of the products...U can set the music, reminders, buy products.. what not...definitely a worthy purchase!!! Facilitates easy home set-up of many Smart devices. We really like that when you call someone you can FaceTime with them! For the price this is a great tablet. Got it for my wife for Christmas and she loves it. Learning all the aps that are on the Kindle, the games and all the free books. I purchased this for my husbandHe had been waiting for it for a long timeHe owns Alexa and loved iti do too MY DAUTHER LOVES THIS TABLET, IS EXCELLENT FOR A 3 YEARS OLD CHILDREN Since installing the Amazon Echo we have been having fun with talking to Alexa. Also the music feature is great My 3 year old got it for his birthday and he loves it! It\\'s amazing. My daughter loves reading on it, watching Netflix, going online to look things up, etc. She loves the touchscreen aspect, and the settings are advanced, but very user friendly. Easy to navigate. Lots of great features for a very low price. The only negative is that the camera is not the best quality. But that\\'s not important to her. Bought the Echo Show because of the display and am not disappointed. The Echo was purchased for somebody as a gift but this was purchased for me and is working great. The only thing that I am disappointed with is that I have to go through Bluetooth to play my music which is on iTunes. The display is also very vivid and clear. Kids love their Kindles!!! Amazon freetime allows them access to tons of age appropriate content. They love the games, apps and videos available to them based on their age. The only reason I give this 4 stars is due to the charging connectors. They are not \"kid friendly\" and the kids bent both of them upon the first time they unplugged their devices on their own. Otherwise, Kindle kids is amazing!!! Easy to use and the HD is awesome. The simplicity as well as the easy to follow directions to set it up is great. It does everything I want it to do. Im impressed with it. I can monitory my Arlo cameras at when ever i want and I can treat my Sirius radio Good stereo sound, but will not control some devices without the use of an external hub. Is good for the kids The only thing is I have to get a SD Card for more memory Really affordable present for a kid.. Or just have around This is a great, easy to use tablet for the price. We purchased the Echo Show for Christmas this year, and love it so much! Our kids got the hang of it faster than we did (ages 11 and 13)! Highly Recommend! This is my 2yr. olds and he loves it. He loves the different games and watching reviews. I bought this for my daughter. It is our 4th Kindle bought within the family. The touchscreen is great and my daughter loves it. In fact, those of us with older model Kindles are jealous. Purchased for my 3 year old, love that it comes with Kindle Freetime (which is almost $80 on it\\'s own). It\\'s perfect for curious fingers prone to swiping and clicking wherever, since the parental controls lock it down to keep them from being able to exit their own profile. Our first unit had an issue after updating the OS, but Amazon is amazing and exchanged the device, no questions asked. I would have gone through Best Buy, but our local one didn\\'t have the pink one in stock anymore. I would have preferred that it didn\\'t come with a camera or microphone for privacy reasons (my older kids 3 year old Kindle Fire HDs don\\'t have a camera or microphone). All-in-all, it is a great device for little ones, but definitely enough power and features to grow with them. great product to use , easy to setup and use.. with all amazon options was supposed to be a gift. there was a glitch in your computer system and it told me I wouldn\\'t receive in time. ordered another one from someone else. then received it anyway. returned to store I\\'m was so pleased with this tablet, I bought a second one for my father. We both love it. Bought this for my grandson. The first one had issues and Best Buy exchanged it. My grandson loves it!!! I bought this item as a Christmas gift for my granddaughter and she has loved every minute of it. It is intuitive, easy to use and she has it in her hands several times every day for everything from research for school to reading a book. Paw Paw hit a homer with this one! Love how loud it get. Shes prefect for everything I need. Easy to navigate. Daughter loves it. It\\'s lightweigh and its just what she needed for this avid reader. Upgraded from echo to this and this is just what I needed. Works well with my new Ring door bell and security cameras. Love the versatility of this. Gave as a gift to niece in hospital she loved it. Was able to do everything on the tablet she wanted to. Easy to use I was the one who set it up for her was very simple. I really enjoy using Alexa even watch videos utube many things it\\'s worth buying Great price works great I have no complaints about the product I would recommend to any one that loves kindle I wanted a tablet mainly to keep by my chair so I could look up stuff, such as information about movies I watch on TV, or answers to the New York Times crossword puzzle, or anything else I was curious about. I didn\\'t want to spend much money, but was still dubious whether such an inexpensive tablet could be any good. I decided that for a measly fifty bucks (plus $20 for extra storage), it was worth a shot. I found that it\\'s perfect for my purposes - relatively fast and easy to use. I haven\\'t used it for downloading or the like, but my guess is it\\'ll be OK there, too. I\\'m happy I bought it. We\\'ve had this tablet for about a month and have no complaints. Great tablet for a kid with lots of storage for games! This tablet operates wonderfully. The size is handy. The graphics vibrant.For the affordable price it is unbeatable :-) Kids love it. Easy for them to use. Only issue is there is a ton of Ads that pop up. I use my kindle on a daily basis. It is a good size for reading in bed. This device is awesome ‚Äò really lets you get very excited about smart home technology ‚Äò I‚Äôm buying a second one for my upstairs Love my Alexa! Having lots of fun asking her questions and enjoy listening to music on it. Echo Show is everything I thought it would be and more. The alarm and music actions are the greatest. It is a great buy. The sound is great quality. Deliveres what I need for a comfortable house I got this kindle because I broke my Fire 7\\'. It took some getting use to since the screen was bigger but overall it was a great purchase. I know many people who have a kindle. It frees up using the cell phone memory, so I bought this one for the amount of storage it has, as well as the cost of the item. Thank you. Easy to use for children. Multiple color tablet covers. Tablets are best used for personal reading. Clear and it like a book. you dont have to sahre If you keep asking it to do things, you will be surprised at how much it can do She is not a technical person but enjoys the screen feature and uses it for cooking recipes. This is an amazing product for reading books and watching movies. What a great tablet for for the grand kids.easy to use,can\\'t say how many times it\\'s hit the floor and no damage. Echo sounds better for music, but Tap gives me portability. Good to have both. Now Tap is voice activated, so it\\'s all good. I like the unit but battery seems to run down more quickly that my previous Fire. Also gets warm while charging. read the reviews, bought this tablet to replace an e-reader. Way more than I expected. Video was better than reviews stated, books load faster than my old one Still getting used to a new OS but I am very pleased Love the Tablet. Wonderful battery life. Great for Movies. Love having the Echo to get quick weather reports, play music, and other helpful information. I had one of the first Kindle fires for years and I loved it. So I wanted another newer one and it\\'s great! Has a good battery. Went to my local Best Buy and a friendly employee greed me and ask me if I needed any help, I ask about the echo and the google assistance and the employee explained the pros and cons of each device and even show me other ones. With his help I end up pickin the new echo Plus (Alexa) and I absolutely LOVE IT! I really like the Phillips Hue Bulb included and I am definitely going to buy more! My customer experience was really great and I am very grateful for the courtesy, knowledge and the time this employee offered me. This experience make me want to come back to this same store for all my needs specially because they can help me choose wisely. Love my Alexa, and love the hue bulb. Now I will be going to buy a new smart tv to control with Alexa next. Great customer service!!! Thank you!! purchased this product while was on sale, very easy to pair, looks well made, very happy with it. I bought this so my kids can talk to there Grandpa and it has been Great they call him all the time Great for keeping around the house and doing basic Internet functions. For traveling it lets you bring books, movies and/or tv shows via Amazon so being Amazon Prime is a plus.For you business travelers, out of the box it can open, view, & edit MS Office files, .docx, .xlsx, & .pptx.All this for 25% the price of a iPad. Yes, the iPad can do more, but do you need it? great tablet for web access and works well gaming no reason to spend more unless you need a larger screen My kids love using it. They use it everyday with YouTube videos Tablets are best used for personal reading. Clear and it like a book. you dont have to sahre I was hesitant, and I am now hooked. This is both fun and useful Great looking design. Amazon Echo Show was easy to set up and use. This product is super easy to use and the sound quality is terrific. I use it every day! The easy of use is also appreciated! This amazon Alexa plus is awesome...it‚Äôs works great and easy to set up Small enough to carry every where. When he is using it, you can hear a pin drop. i purchased this to go along with my smart lights. it links up right away. i am satasified with this purchase. I I bought this for a friend since she liked mine so much.It is a great way to check emails and read Kindle e-Books.I keep an SD card in mine and store my books on it. You can just drop this in your purse to read on the go. I love the echo show! The only thing I dislike is it doesn\\'t play YouTube videos. Not a deal breaker though. Really enjoying this device so far,,,my smart phone is basic Tracfone...currently adding smart lighting...will probably switch to a tablet for controlling and adding to a future (limited) smart home This will be a great gift for the whole house too enjoy. I purchased 2 of these FIre HD tablets as gifts. They pack a lot of punch for the price. I helped set them up so I was able to get an idea of how they are going to work. The screen was very nice and clear. Speed of tablet was good. It is easy to use. If you are already in the Amazon family through prime it is a no-brainer.I don\\'t believe you can get a better tablet at this price point. Aiden\\'s is loving his tablet, using educational apps learning his letters and numbers Purchased the echo after hearing it at a neighbors. Good quality speaker for the small size. NEW LARGER SCREENIS GREAT FOR WATCHING PRIME MOVIES AND READING BOOKS Absolutely Awesome! Great product, recommend that Everyone have one! A great alternative to the more expensive tablets. Battery lasts for quite a while. Love the convenience of being able to turn on a light or other appliances connected to smart switches with voice commands. Also very convenient music streaming, news and weather reports. This is my second Kindle. The first was a gift several years ago. The display and speed are much better. I bought this for myself and another one for a gift, you must have Wi-Fi to use as well as a smart phone. Samsung Experience Professionals Jon, Neil and Tony were an ideal match for someone looking to upgrade to a new phone. The sales deal was unbelievable - $200 Best Buy card upon upgrade to a Galaxy 7 phone. The sales points that won my business were battery life and charging power. New phone can connect wireless charge without adapter. I am a very happy customer. Good price, travels well, has a lot of good features, compact, user friendly. i love my kindle ..i read on a plane or at the pool, works in different lighting and angles I love that I have the ability to catch up on news and have this crazy thing turn on and off my lights. Love it!! Works great. Turns H&A up and down. Tv on and off. Lights on and off. All from Alexa. You do have to have apps and special lights. I bought two of these, one for my son and the other for nephew, they love it. I downloaded kidsmode on it and all their educational games they can play besides regular Games. Love Amazon however their tablet limits you to using their browser and their apps. Go online and you can get around them and download google and the playstore. Made my Fire into regular android tablet. Much happier now. This replaced my old original kindle fire. What a great upgrade. Be sure to join Amazon Prime and have access to lots of free reading downloads Love it . Easy to use. No problems setting it up!!!! My kids are 18 months and 4 and they love this tablet. It\\'s easy for them to use and very lightweight User friendly, hand free little assistant. Makes your mornings easier and gets you started for the day. And it looks cool I bought this tab for my daughter\\'s birthday.its got a good screen and sound for the price. I also play for the children\\'s app freetime which is perfect for her. Upgraded; easy to use; thinner; very happy with it. My 3yr. old loves this tablet. Easy for her to use. She watches videos plays games. Bought it for my wife and I haven\\'t heard any complaints, so I think it\\'s great. If she\\'s happy I\\'m happy it works well and sounds very good and the pictures are good too It\\'s a great device to have. It does so many things. Very practical. This is a great tablet. Great for the price. Very fast and easy to use. This is my 2nd tablet. Kindle Fire hd 8 reviewed throughly elsewhere many times for its solid performance for money. I mainly wanna talk about excellent buying experience at local best buy. It was not in Stock but employee we extra miles to locate the stock somewhe re but I like my local store much so ended up ordering there. Keep up the good work !. Very pleasant buying experience. I sent it for my granddaughter as a birthday gift, seemingly she\\'s enjoying and learning thru it. Good features and quality. Would be nice if it worked better in low light. Should have stepped up for the backlit one. This is nice if your conditions are bright. I absolutely love my Kindle-Fire HD 10 16 GB. I can read it day OR night without light. And the picture quality is amazing! I haven\\'t had any problems with it so far other than it\\'s so thin, you need a case so you don\\'t drop it. Very easy to add games, music, and books. I have even ordered items through Amazon without problems. I highly recommend this product. We love it, I find new things to do with it every day, I am just learning what the Amazon Echo Show will do. I\\'ve used it as a timer, I\\'ve listened to Iheart radio, I love the smart lights that I bought at the same time. Alexa turns them on/off when I tell her to. When the holiday rush is over, I will go online to learn many more things. Best speaker with Alexa enabled. Value of money!! I had 3 dots and decided to get the echo plus. Great product so far. Controls my hue lights. Grandkids love asking it questions. It needs the Internet to connect to your devices and play music. Sometimes you can be cut off. The rest of the time it is easy as can be. this kindle is very light so easy to hold for a long time without getting tired - worth upgrading your older version kindle... Best New Adult Toy in years! Wish I had purchased one for my parents. LOVE IT!!!! a bit difficult to set up, but it is amazing. Love the screen! Very easy to use and does everything I need it to do. Would have given it 5 stars but it hasn\\'t changed enough from the last Kindle that I purchased several years ago. Wife love it, reads a lot and this is her go to reader. Good customer service during my quest to get a good deal and quality gadget. Purchased it for my daughter. She love this very much. It is really good. They had the tablet in stock and it is nice that it has the child settings It is a nice little no frills tablet, but it could be better, for one it is only limited to amazons web browser, and I like chrome. It is no big deal because what I paid for it I did not expect it to be blazing fast or anything like that. I have a lot of Echos devices. Each room in my house has some kind of smart speaker (I have also Google Home devices).The Echo Show is the best device to use in a living room or kitchen. The screen is bright and sharp, and it\\'s a nice feature to follow recipes, watch videos or even listen to music once the lyrics are displayed on the screen.It\\'s also the best way to see calendar entries, to do and shopping lists. This is perfect for any home it gives up to date news, you can set alarms and do so much more. We love this product Bought for my son for Easter. He loves it and easy for him to use. great for different apps for learning. I resisted getting this since I already have two Echo units and one Dot. Black Friday gave me reason to buy one. I LOVE IT twice as much as the regular Echo. The set up is faster and easier and I love the visuals. I use my Shopping List and To Do List A LOT and having it display and being able to edit it without logging into the app makes it so much more worth it. I may be getting another :) It‚Äôs great I use it a lot and yes I will tell friends and family about it I didn\\'t want to buy my 8 year old something really expensive but I wanted a good device so I tried this out and she loves it. The case that comes with it makes it almost indestructible. My wife wanted this, so I got it as a gift. Even though I have had an Amazon Echo for a year, I think the Show is much better. The screen takes a lot of the mystery out of what Alexa is doing. Both my wife and daughter love it. It makes me so happy to listen all kind of their music station This is my 4th Kindle - I use it as a tablet when I travel Could not have asked for a better tablet for the money. I wasn\\'t looking for anything extreme. Just wanted it to look nice and do it\\'s job for games and browsing. Well it does that and more. Gave it to our son for Christmas and now I want one myself. We are going to buy another for my mother in law. Lightweight, simple layout. Snappy. Can\\'t go wrong. I love this tablet. The size fits perfectly in one hand. The display is wonderful and the loaded apps have me reading again. It is the absolute best! This is my second kindle. Love size of screen and it is super light. Great camera. We like using the Echo. Probably didn\\'t need the plus because we are just using it to play music on Amazon music. I prefer the Kindle to a book. I like the change of letter size, storing many, many books, and the ease of carrying it. I love to read when I travel, and this is the way to go. I bought this for my daughter as a Christmas present and she loves it. She loves it, the only problem I have is getting it away from her, even while riding in vehicles. LOL As advertised...................................... Used in my home office, gives me all of the information I ask for while my computers are doing other chores. Plays any music that I request, decent quality sound. I\\'m very happy with this tablet..My nephew loves it. I bought Geek Squad for 2 years. Well after 13 months my device became broken. So the warranty came in handy. Thank you knowing things happend in life. This tablet is for my daughter and she absolutely loves it! Great kindle, perfect size screen, I love using it just as much as my iPad mini and regular size iPad! Easier to travel with! This little device is great for it price. Lots of features. Bought for my 2 yr old grandson.. and he loves it has a lot of learning numbers alphabet and shapes Bought this tablet for my 84 year old grandpa and he loves it. Easy to use i have had not issues with my purchase. i found a great cover for it on line on amazon and use it every night. thank you for your service. Great addition to all the other electronics in our home I would recommend this to all of our friends and family. It\\'s worth every penny. Good warranty, comes with a free subscription, works quickly and is very durable! I bought this tablet for my grandson and he absolutely loves it!!!!! Love the communications with alexa and the new home display. Bought for mother, she loves it! Good price, in stock, and an easy purchase. I love how I can see my grandkids. I also bought my kids one so they can just \"Drop In\" and I can see them. It also shows words to some songs to sing along. It is fun to have!! Purchased as a replacement for a Kindle and it functions well as a Kindle and a tablet. What I really like is that you can set up different profiles( boy,girl and myself ) and still you can use any device to play to favorite profile.I bought 2 and kids are very happy. This tablet has far exceeded my expectations. The price was way lower than most other tablets but it does everything I need and want. I love my Kindle Voyage, however it does not have a speaker for audio books. and changes settings ie. remaining time/pages left in book on it\\'s own. Excellent product very good piece strongly recommend The speaker is loud enough to cover my room but I still connect external speakers. The hub portion of the device works well, although I wish it had more capabilities when it comes to controlling hue lighting. Bought this with the intention of reading more, it serves it\\'s purpose! I will be purchasing another one soon for my nephew, for his books and learning games. I have had this for around a month and i love it. It makes it simple to set timers and control my lights Never without my Amazon HD 8 - great for reading, games and surfing the networks. Bought this for my grandniece, keeps her entertained. Can\\'t beat the price. My daughter absolutely loves her new fire, lots of space, easy to set up and lots of apps i love the kindle fire 7 tablet. it is wonderful and awesome. Purchased as a gift. The receiver loves it and said that it works nicely. We bought this to view our Arlo Pro cameras on something other than our iPhones. The Show does a great job of this. It is a fantastic Alexa device. My minor complaints are that it is slightly smaller than expected and you can‚Äôt view YouTube videos on it. Not huge deals at all, but minutely disappointing. Much lighter than my old kindle. Love it, love the fact that it has the camera too I purchased this Kindle for my daughter and she really enjoys using it !! This tablet is a good choice for little kids. It is not very expensive and provide nice features for the price. You can beat this!!! Bought 2 for each of my children ( 10 & 15) and they love them. I was a little worried about them adapting to a new operating system, no problems there. The sound and playback images are just fine. They take them everywhere, not like leaving their other tablets at home, I\\'m thinking about buying me one. Very kid durable I got this because it is almost impossible to break Bought for my son as a birthday gift and as a way to not wear out his laptop. Works great especially for videos and general online use. Love asking Alexis all kinds of questions and listening to great Amazon Music!!!! I own a Kindle HDX 8.9 and wanted something small and portable... WOW is all I can say when I got my hands on the Kindle Oasis ( Thank you Babes :) ). The Kindle Oasis is very tiny, portable & fits in about anything from a jeans back pockets to a very very small purse! The clarity of the screen is awesome. The touch of it works perfect! Very different than my HDX BUT I HIGHLY RECOMMEND it! A little more pricey than the paperwhite BUT this one already comes with the case and a built in battery in the case so you are set for long time reading & the price is fair since the others you would still have to buy a case for it! Keep in mind the case for the oasis is leather and you can choose from black, brown and red (red was my choice., which to me it\\'s not red it\\'s more of a wine red color) it\\'s beautiful! Picture shows My Kindle Oasis in the middle of the IPhone 7 Plus (left) & Samsung S8+ (right) so you can get an idea on the size... it\\'s super cute! It\\'s tinier than the Kindle paperwhite! This tablet is great for ebooks and small apps. Kid friendly.I feel like it runs slower than apple products. But can\\'t beat the price overall. I recommend it for kids .great for find games easily. This 8 inch Fire is definitely better than the cheaper 7 inch. It works fine enough for teens to play games and watch movies. My daughter loved it . Best gift for the price it comes with way more then I could have expected Is a notch up product.. with inbuilt hub, echo has opened up the door for easy connectivity with other products. My 8 year old niece cracked her screen on her former tablet, I needed to get her a replacement. This tablet fit the bill exactly, a great screen, relatively fast CPU, and best of all, it\\'s cheap!I was able to find instructions online for installing Google PlayStore, in which I then gave her the tablet. She loves it! I actually had a kindle. But I have grand daughters and they always want to play with it when they come over .. Soo removed all my books from it and put their games on it and got me a new one for me... Now we are all happy. They watch you tube and Netflix and play games. It\\'s a win win. Works well for browsing and reading. It also has great apps. I needed to upgrade from the orginal Kindle fire and this Fire works great. Videos,games, email and battery life all are great. I absolutely love Alexa! This device is loud, easy to install, and does exactly what I tell her to do. Great addition to the amazon device family. Great Christmas gift. Alexa can make you crazy but it‚Äôs worth the aggravation. Never owned a tablet before, but am loving it so far. This was a Christmas present. The person that received it was very happy with it.. She has other Kindles but this new one is an obvious improvement over the previous ones. We purchased this as a gift. Researching and word of mouth led us to purchase this one. Very user friendly. I love my tap. It sounds great and is so easy to use. I really didnt expect how its going to work.but its very good.gifted to my friend Purchased this because I was buying the echo dot for my daughter and thought this would be fun for the family. We play music every day on it. Every one in the family is enjoying it. Only dislike is that it doesn‚Äôt have the hub. Love it so much! Have been using it every day...news, YouTube videos... buying more smart home products to make good use of Alexa. It is a reliable easy to use tablet. Holds charge well and provides for my needs. Great tablet for kids my boys love their tablets!! Happy with the purchase, found it on sale could not pass it up! Setting this up was about as easy as one could expect. The Echo Plus is an amazing device and I got a free smart light bulb with a package deal. :-) The display is so much better than my previous Kindle Fire and have found more uses for it. It\\'s nice to pull up my Comcast app and watch shows while working out on the treadmill. It was a pleasant surprise to find that Alexa was loaded as well! My wife loves the tablet! She\\'s only using it for internet so far and it has worked flawlessly! Much better screen resolution than my 7 inch fire. I love my kindle it makes it so much easier to read books instead of having to carry them with me Love the new echo show. has so many more features that my echo dot. I have the original Echo and just purchase the Echo Plus. Better speakers and can act as a hub for the Philips Hue Bulbs without having to purchase another hub. Very satisfied with its performance. Gave it as a gift to provide a sense of safety and security for someone living in the country. Turning the lights on before entering the house is a big deal when you live alone. This Amazon Fire is better then I expected. It does exactly what I need it to do. Fits in my bag, very light weight. Love that I can carry so many book on one device. I love the tablets HD picture is beautiful. The fire tablet is very fast to load and is easy to use. Great tablet. Love all my Echo products and this one is exceptional as well. Was able to look in my house while away. Waiting for more update for access to apps in the future. Great tablet for the kids and adults great features like the rubber case and free features for kids Easy to use and it arrived exactly as described. Good beginner device for youngsters who want a device to read from. I had looked at this for a while. I was thinking about purchasing it when Amazon was offering the buy on get the second one for less offer, but when both they and Best Buy dropped the price to $149 I jumped on it. It\\'s perfect for my kitchen because I can use the screen to pull up recipes and I can video chat with my kids that live out of State. I would say that this is a great addition to any Smart Home. Bought my 11 year old niece and my 7 year old nephew one a piece for their Birthdays and they love it! Great Tablet for all ages and very user friendly. It\\'s actually a very good product for a decent price. Not lightning fast but it is okay for everyday use. ilovemy kindle 8\" . However it has crash a couple of times and am not sure why. also the 8\" case is not made for this kindle because the clamps used to hold it are right on the buttons to turn on and volume. so if you have a better case for it please let me know. I like this so much more than the Voyage. The shape makes for easier holding. I only wish this devise was maybe 2 inches taller then it would look like a real book bought it for my son. he likes it. very good alternate to expensive tables out there. Most of the Kindles I have purchased have been gifts, but this one was for me. It is just what I expected from the reviews. Great tablet for the money. I will definitely recommend this product . The tech support is also easy and friendly. Alexa keeps my husband company during the day answering his questions. Tablet is easy to work with only can be slow to come up on certain sites I purchased two for my grandchildren. They loved it. Reading, games and videos I have several Amazon Echo\\'s throughout my house. Home automation is great and these work with everything that I have. Great sounds! Works great with Ring doorbell and nest cameras as well! :) I bought these for my niece and nephews for Christmas. They love them! They know how to turn them on and locate an app. I love being able to set time limits so they aren\\'t on their tablets very often! Great investment! Works well; no issues with reboots or system hangs.. Good size - not too big and not too small. Screen is good for reading. Battery life is good, I\\'ve bought a few books from Amazon but mostly side-loaded books from the library onto a 32 GB micro sd card. I love everything about it.... it is portable, sounds better than most portable speakers, and Alexa rocks it. Only thing that kept it from a 5 star rating is that you have to manually activate Alexa. Wish it would work like the Echo and Dot, while it is on its base. I\\'ve purchased 5 of these for my kids the last few years. While they are playing a tablet or two, I keep the other tablets charged. I\\'ve enjoyed using them myself. It was a perfect gift for my godson. He loved it! Definitely would recommend this product. Built-in hub only lets your control Philips Hue with your voice. You still need the Philips Hue hub to be able to use the Hue app. I ended up buying the Hue hub as well. Has better speaker than the regular Echo. The functionality is great although I wish it came in more colors. Love the parental controls and more storage than previous models, but still seems to run out. He is a wizard with computers and tablets and knows much more than me. Wish the angle was adjustable. When this is sitting on a table or counter it is angled up and the further away from it you sit, the less likely it will see you in its view when trying to call someone. Love the Sirus XM update to play through this though. The speaker seems louder and better than the regular Echo, but that is just my thought. If you were able to get two for price of one, this is a deal worth taking. Nice product for the price. It does what we need it to do. Easy to use and handy to have with you instead of a heavy laptop. 4 year old grand daughter loves it. Good size for her and easy to operate. I love my new Amazon Fire! I was very easy to use.. I mainly bought the Echo plus for my kids but I‚Äôm using it more than they do. Excellent product!! Great price great product would recommend this gift I love that the kids can only do what you allow them to they can\\'t get to the internet unless you put it on there profile which I don\\'t because I have a four and 2 year old, there apps are very easily accessed and are big so they can b seen very well . also these tablets double and can b used as a regular tablet for grown ups This tablet is so much easier to use than my 6\" fire. It is great for reading or eatching movies. Very little set up, Amazon helpful in setting up the functions. Clear pictures and easy to use. Take pictures both ways My daughter loves it. She loves the books that she can read. I was looking for and cost effective solution to satisfy my childrens desires to have there own SmartPhone to play Games.I like the Parental controls, to limit certain actions and downloads. Making our home smart and adding Echo has been great! So convenient! Very fun to have music at the ready with a voice command. We use it with Amazon Unlimited which has nearly everything. Good to view recipes with Allrecipes, so we keep it in the kitchen for reference and musical ambience. The video is good too, it has youtube functionality. It would be nice to have regular tv though, but that is probably on the providers for now.. nice to have the photo background and lastly, to have lyrics on the screen when music is played! I love to read but don\\'t have the space to keep a collection of books. For me, this Kindle is the best of both worlds. I can enjoy reading a good book without having to find shelf space to store it later. I was a bit reluctant to jump on the Alexa wagon, but now that I have, I don‚Äôt know why! This is awesome. Still figuring out all the things I can do but only because there are so many! The protective rubber guard works so well. Easy parental controls I especially like the Amazon has a system to convert pdf to kindle format. Some of the things I read (journal articles) are in pdf format and I can email them to my kindle email and it shows up on my kindle with kindle format (larger text). You can find your kindel email at your account information. Only thing, I would have like a screen little larger. Great little device easy to connect to bluetoothDecent sound For a basic tablet, this is perfect. Good price. Does all I need it to! It was bought as a Christmas gift so therefore no review. Good to use it to read books under light.the price is lower than other website. The sales associate was knowledgeable enough to lead me in the right direction in purchasing this product that‚Äôs compatible with my mother‚Äôs Arlo Security cameras. It works great! I truly love this item ,its amszing good . Will do I haven\\'t used any other kindle before, but this kindle was made to do its job and it does it properly. It is sleek, lightweight and sturdy. I love putting it in my bag and taking it with me wherever I go - just in case I get a chance to read. Like it says in the description, you can download books and read it anywhere - you don\\'t need wifi to read. Battery life is great. It has a matted screen and you can make the font as big or as small as you want. The down side is that the screen is small, so you can only get through so much before you have to flip the screen. Also there is no brightness controller for the screen so you can only read it where it\\'s light. But I honestly love my kindle, it does it\\'s job and I don\\'t want anything that get\\'s fancier than this. This product is so very convenient I have day I don\\'t want to get up and she helps me My kids love their amazon kindles! They can take them anywhere and play on them! Great battery life! Like the idea of having a built-in hub to control other smart home devices as we get them.Sound quality is marginally better, but we didn\\'t buy Echos as audiophiles...but for background music and it\\'s perfect for that.My only complaint to date is that we have to accounts in our home and Amazon Echo must have one or the other. That makes it frustrating for the other user (particularly when playing configuring music to play in all rooms). Perfect for educational games. The protective case sold me. Great product and it is very easy to set up and use Good picture and sound quality. Handy size. Meets my needs and then some. We love it! The whole family likes to ask questions. Excellent Reader and Product for the price. Very easy to use Bought this tablet for my son..great battery life, shipped fast..great value! Bought this fire for my wife to replace one which got accidently broken.great It\\'s not bad for the novelty of Alexa. Might as well get the echo. Sound it not bad and I\\'m no audiophile. Might be good when my echo dots come in. Is it worth it? There are better Bluetooth speakers out there. Alexa really amazes me. She learns new skills everyday. Yes, it‚Äôs a little glitchy sometimes. But so useful and fun! I‚Äôm hoping that over time Amazon will continue to improve on the errors in Alexa. When contacting customer service, it doesn‚Äôt seem like Amazon is very interested in learning the problems that need fixing though. I purchased this so my daughter could read her online books. Perfect size! I got it for my kid and she loves it. The amazon free time and prime well worth the money The show works great with my other products. Love it I originally purchased this to use as a Bluetooth speaker for my wife\\'s music but soon realized that we would use this much more than we thought. Ya, turning on and off lights is good and being able to dim with the included bulb is pretty great but there are hundreds of smart home type of apps that work with this including my Sony Google TV and more show up regularly. Makes it almost too easy to be lazy. Alexa on the go. Works as Bluetooth speaker with your comparable phone. Bought for my daughter instead of an I-pad. Works well, love the Amazon Underground App Store, but battery life doesn\\'t seem to last as long as older I-pads. Easy enough though for a child to use. Was super easy to connect via Bluetooth - great sound, fun to use. Well, I bought this on a lark. And to my surprise, I\\'m using it all day long to get the news alerts, check the weather, and listen to music. Works well, and even understands my relatively heavy southern accent. I have several around the house and love playing music on them Kind of hard adding smart items but when you do it‚Äôs nice to just talk and not get on computer or smart phone to control I bought this as a gift for my husband and he is constantly asking Alexa questions about everything. We love listening to music on it as well. We bought the Amazon Echo Show for my dad. We set up accounts for him to access music and pictures and wrote down a sample list of commands he could use. He loves it. Excellent product. No end to the features you can set up. This thing is cool, you can do a lot of neat things with the show, hope they add more functionality to Alexa though. Love the case, table works very well, easy to download game and apps, but the life of the battery is not great. The battery fully charged only last about 3-4 hours We are used to iPads in our house. This has taken some learning to get used to a slightly different format, but it works great!! The price point is perfect for kids to use without the worry. Bought this for my 3 year old grandson and he loves it good learning tool along with great fun for him! I purchased this as a gift for my grandfather. He was excited when he opened it and will get great use out of it while he is in doors for winter. I really like this product. My Son got us the Alexa Show for Christmas and I wanted one that would turn on lights and other items. So we purchased this because it has the bridge so that you can use it with the Phillips Hue lights. It works great. I have the Show in the kitchen and I have the Echo in my bedroom. I love that it has a great built in speaker. I can have it play my music in both rooms at the same time..... My other one last for two years. Than went out. My daughter loves it At the price it is almost an impulse buy. I wanted a tablet for an upcoming trip to watch some movies, read, etc and this was at a price point that made the decision really easy. If you are used to an iPad, the Fire HD is a little disappointing but it costs considerably less. It fit my needs but I felt some slugginess and several instances of needing to reboot to get certain apps to work correct. If you go in with the understanding this isn\\'t an iPad replacement this should fit the bills for you. Let\\'s just say, after my trip I purchased an iPad Pro and this item will likely be handed off to one of my children. If you have Amazon Prime, you do get some nice perks that make this a really nice item. Perfect technology for my 11 year old son for games, reading, and homework. I added this to my echo collection great for on the go and around the house. I don\\'t like that you have to tap it to activate Picked this up to have a portable option for playing music in the garage. Love that it\\'s battery powered. Never had an issue of it running out of juice. The only issue I have is with the mics, it doesn\\'t respond to your voice as well as the Echo or Dot. Then again it wasn\\'t really designed to listen for the Alexa command since it originally required you to \"tap\" the speaker to get it to listen. This is a great personal speaker. I have both the Tap and the Echo. The only downside to the tap is you actually have to physically \"tap\" the mic button to activate Alexa. The sound quality is pretty good for the price. If you can afford it, I would upgrade to the Echo. I am enjoying my Kindle very much! Easy to down load books and easy to read! Very happy with my purchase! nice and compact, great sound, easy to use, love it. a gift. He LOVES it. was a reasonable price. thks. We are enjoying our amazon echo show. Alexa is so amazing answering questions and a variety of music!!!! Kindle is the perfect E-reader. Easy to use and size is perfect to bring \\'book\\' on the go. Excellent. Just as good as iPad with a fraction of the price. The Echo Show is hands down the best device of the Echo lineup. I‚Äôve bought at least one of everyone except the Tap. I use this to call and check on my grandparents, who I got one for Christmas. It‚Äôs amazing watching my arlo and ring cameras on the screen. Also watching news segments and looking at cooking recipes/videos is great. It‚Äôs also the easiest to set up of the Echo Devices, you don‚Äôt even need to use the app, Gets use everyday by my girlfriend who i bought it for with no complaints, also love the color. Also may get one for myself. Great tablet, very clear picture. Would buy again. Great sound and function! ‚ù§Ô∏è Alexa! The color and style of the silver plus looks great with our newly finished basement. I\\'ve always been a reader and an early technology adopter but until now I\\'ve resisted moving to electronic media when reading for pleasure. Now I wish I hadn\\'t waited so long. Reading at night with the lights off and instantly downloading a new book are my favorite aspects. i bought this on a whim because my brother recommended i try it sometimes. hard to believe how important this is in my life. this has opened up my long forgotten youth with music and videos anytime Bought for my 88 year old Mom, she loves it, help her with recipes and cooking. Small, light, but comfortable to hold with either hand. If you keep it in airplane mode with medium lighting, the battery last for weeks. Lovin\\' it so far. Great price for a Kindle Fire. Lightweight, easy to hold and use. It\\'s perfect for me when I\\'m doing homework or just surfing the web when I\\'m at a Starbucks or just at home. I purchased this tablet for my 3 year old and he loves it! Very easy to use and setup. I bought this as a way to easily read while on the go. I\\'m disappointed as it\\'s really too big too easily carry around. I\\'ve discovered it\\'s not all that easy to use it for reading purposes My daughter loves her tablet. Amazon has plenty of games for her to play. It is also easy for her to use. I bought one a month ago for my 6 year old Granddaughter as she is always on mine. So I gave this one to her 9 year old brother for his birthday this month! Love the Kindles We love this whole system!!! Easy to use and very useful! Great all around tablet. Color and resolution is very nice. Best price for a nice product. I gave my Paperwhite to a friend and bought the Voyage. I like the clearness of the screen and how easy it is to turn pages. I don\\'t know that it\\'s really worth all of the extra cost compared to the Paperwhite, especially since the new one just came out with 300 dpi. My 2 yr old loves it!!! We got it in pink. Love that you can put restrictions on it, as well as a timer so that theyre not on it too long. The games and books are awesome My daughter likes this tablet to play her online games! I bought this for my wife for Christmas and she loves it. The screen is big and alexa responds clearly and quickly. Grandson loves this tablet, does everything he needs I wanted a lighted ebook reader and also access to the internet in a small format. The Fire meets my needs at a great price. I was literally still using my first gen Kindle Fire and finally upgraded. I love the new one. The only negative is the speakers. My first one is louder than this one. Video quality is very good. Works well with Amazon Prime Video and Music - no surprises there. Apps are VERY disappointing - many common apps are not available - even though there are Android versions! Not bad if you have modest expectations. My teens needed something they could use to read favorite books, watch movies, edit photos, and catch up with friends on social media. The Kindle Fire 7 tablet covered all this and more at a great price. Great Christmas gifts for the kids. Hours of fun and games. I would like to say that it\\'s a great tablet, just too small(will buy bigger one next time!!) I had reviewed and looked at this Samsung 65\" 4k HDTV and at this timeit was the best for the money..Very satisfied with TV and would recommend it to anyone. Love it, easy to operate. Very reasonable price - on sale. just what I was looking for to putin my guest room. It has a good picture bought this as a present for the wife, but as I relaxed for the holiday requested six hours of different song play. The wife enjoyed the music as the music emanated through the open areas of our house. The wife received information on measures for recipes, weather updates, etc. this will be one of those classic gifts. Alexa is awesome to have at home makes things fun and easy Product is good, light. Amazing battery backup. I charge the Kindle one in 4 weeks. Great product for reasonable price. USB connection is easy, Books are easy to download. Overall, everyone must have Kindle with them and this is the best product/model to start with.Understandably, this is the beginner level model for people who never used Kindle before. Features like LED lights, White paper background are not available on this model. These features are there on higher models so one cannot read it in Dark without lights. But again, for this price you would not get any other good readers.If you are someone who reads in dark then I would suggest go for Higher Kindle models. My son just love playing games on this tablet. Its easy and fun! The table is great just to experience what is available on a tablet without a hugh expense. I would recommend to others. This was a great purchase! I love my echo plus with the hue light bulb. The set up is really easy and you can hook up your amazon account and order from Alexa. You can program your lights to be turned on at a certain time every day or even download the app and turn them on remotely. I love how this product is compatible with nest products. This was purchased as a gift for an avid reader and as a streaming media device. I looked at the bigger kindle but this one is the right compromise between size and portability for the planned uses. Great purchase. We bought this to make it easier to turn off lights, etc. It\\'s perfect for connecting the whole house. I live in a small apartment and this fan kept the whole place cool. Love this bot and lighting system. It transforms my house into many moods. Planning to get more lights and maybe another bot. Already an amazon consumer and user of Alexa to control home automation products. The Show is a great addition for us in the kitchen, displaying receipts and visualizing things that before could only be heard. This is my first Fire Kindle. I love it. It is fast, and has good internet. It gives me quick access to all my Kindle library. I found out it\\'s easier to scroll through the pages than when using Kindle Touch. pretty convenient to have another cable to charge the kindle,, great price and ready to have it on hand My sons love playing on their tablet. Not only does it allow me additional time to get things done but they enjoy the educational apps provided. A great Christmas gift, great for listening to music I‚Äôve been using the Amazon Echo from the day it was released to the market. Unfortunately the volume control wheel broke. I quickly went over to my local best buy and purchased the next generation. There are amazing improvements concerning this device. I Really And Truly Are In Love With Alexa. I don‚Äôt know what I would do without her I love how you are able to get a visual effect along with audio from Alexa Quality comes with apps installed durrible love the case Purchased this for my Down Syndrome sister who enjoy playing games on it. Will work well for the purpose it was purchased. My child will love the fun and games that he can play. Very child appropriate and user friendly. I would encourage any parent to buy this product. Easy to use. Pretty user friendly. It is good value for the price Christmas gift so it\\'s to early to tell, arrived on time nice reader. almost perfect for what i want/need. good bargain easy to use plenty of space for a kid recommend warranty Goog tablet the only bad part is that you have to be creating a profile and thats where it gets complicated because when they sell u the tablet they saw its for kids easy to use great product and BEST BUY ANSWERED MY QUESTIONS Bought for my kids and they love them!! They love the camera! By far my favorite Amazon product. I bought one for every bedroom in the home. Looked for a tablet for reading books and light web surfing. This fits that need. What an amazing piece of technology. I was impressed with the sound quality I bought this for my 14 year old daughter and she loves it!!!! I didn\\'t think I needed Alexa to have a screen, but now I\\'m so glad we got this. When I ask to see my grocery list, it pops up on the screen. Also can do video calls from it. Really like our Alexa and the dots...we have them in almost every room of the house now. OK, I was so unsure of this Kindle because it does not have all of the bells and whistles of the others. BUT I am very happy with it. I love my Kindle! I have managed to read a book a week on it sicnce I got if for Christmas. I have been reading the free books on Kindle. There are so many to pick from. While home, I download the books that I want to read and then while I am in the car or waiting at the DMV, I just pull of the book and read. It remembers where I am in the book. This Kindle does not have the back light. I was nervous about that but so far this has not been a problem because the light it has is fine for me. When I am reading in the car, I enlarge the font and it makes seeing the words easier for me. That is the most important factor for me because I can get car sick if I read while riding in the car but with the larger font I don\\'t have that problem. I wear glasses with bifocals and holding this seems to be more comfortable than a book because I can hold it up if I need to. The size is perfect! Again, I can enlarge the font so the smaller screen size really has nothing to do with the readability. Love it!! I bought this tablet for my son and he enjoys using it the only thing I don\\'t love is that u need internet to use most apps on it and you cant download youtube kids. It has a lot of apps though and a lot of learning material for all ages. It is great to be able to have all you books in the same place... Easy to use meet standards my kids really enjoyed it Works better than the 7\" Amazon Fire tablet I have. Better screen, faster processor and bigger to boot. Love the ability to video chat with grand kids, Enjoying the music everyday. Fast, solid, all the necessary features for an ebook. I like the side pressure page advance and the small size fits my small hands. This tablet is quad core CPU and has plenty of space for you to download more apps. I\\'m an avid reader. The Kindle is my go to for ease. It fits in my purse or knitting bag and stays charged for days. Well designed, good sound, has everything Alexa has plus the HD video. Always ready with answers with associated video or text if applicable. Can show movie trailers, can also watch Amazon video. Excellent on-demand security video with Amazon compatible cameras. Voice activated message and/or video calls to Amazon Show owners or Alexa App holders. Highly recommended. Easy to use. Very lightweight. Would recommend to anyone Love the simplicity. Also love that I use it for reading only and can\\'t download distracting apps. This is so easy to use and does exactly what I hoped. This is my 2nd Amazon tablet. I love it. I also bought one for my husband & mother in law. I own a dot and a first gen echo and the sound from the show is way better than both of my other echoes. The video functions are nice but it is a pain to get it to play videos from my Amazon library. My family enjoys the calendar info and the news briefings that rotate on the screen. The visual quality on the Fire 8 HD is amazing. It runs very fast and is easy to use, very durable. I am very satisfied with this tablet. I use it for browsing because the screen is larger than my phone. Caught it on sale and bought two. Good value for the money. It was recommended by a friend. Get a case for it, it is easier to hold on to. The second one will make a nice gift. Overall product is excellent. Speakers should have a capability to be used as Bluetooth speakers like the echo. My granddaughter really likes it. \"She\" found age-appropriate games to play. Got this for my grandson 7 yrs old - perfect size. Many features packed into a low price. Good as an ereader or light tablet uses to surf internet, email and games. Easy to use. Memory is expandable too. I love this new Alexa device with the screen. I bought it for my mother who really couldn\\'t \"relate\" to the Echo Dot. But she can read the output. I works seamlessly with my Apple Calendar so she can see her activities of the day. Also can call her Great Grandchildren just by talking, and see them too! my son loves his new tablet. now he can play his games without making a mess of my phone. I previously had a nook that died and tried the Fire and I was hooked. Great price and lots of things to do Decent camera, clarity on the screen, fast downloads. Got 2 of these for Christmas gifts for our grandsons & they love them! Good set of apps available and it is robust enough for the kids to abuse. great if you want to read, watch a show, catch up on email, or casually browse the internet. I already has an older version of the Kindle, but this one is even better. I love the touch screen and the ability to scroll without buttons. Great tablet for the purpose of reading, also inexpensive Has been very durable with kids and easy to use. Great product for price. I was using this for a while it was 10X faster then my kindle 5th generation yes 1gb of ram but the App Store made from Amazon is not the best so I downloaded the google play store to get the apps I mostly used I only use my kindle fire had 8 for books and reading or watching YouTube or the web I\\'m giving the rating 4 stars This was a gift for my grandson and he loves it. It is easy to use and keeps him occupied for hours. This is the best of both worlds. A reasonably priced BT speaker and an Amazon Alexa enabled device. I would highly recommend to anyone looking for a BT speaker and considering an Alexa enabled device. I bought this as a gift for my father. He absolutely loves it!! This was a great Christmas gift for my kid. This allows them to store their favorite books and play some educational games. Its nice to also have an optional MicroSD card for extra storage. This tablet can be literally dropped over a thousand times and the screen wont crack. I bought the HD 6 when it came out for my daughter. I just had to replace it because it wasn\\'t charging anymore, it wasn\\'t the cord itself but the device on the inside failed to identify that the cord was plugged in.The best quality tablet i have ever seen. Amazon has a great product and will never buy any other brand of tablet. Exceeded my expectation. Easy to read, books load and store with ease ! Great for saving space for avid reader. I can travel with many books dont have to worry about space Great for video calling grandparents who are not real tech savvy. They also enjoy music on demand. works great, easy to use. play videos and game good We have always been Nexus Tablet desciples, and in fact have bought 6-8 of them for self and family members. This one was for granddaughter to replace Nexus that had gotten slow.This one works better/faster than the Nexus! It\\'s fast....easy to use; perfect tablet for a child or teenager...and can\\'t beat the price!Very pleased with purchase.... Once I understand how to use this, it will be awesome Got this for my 18 month old son so that he can watch movies on our trip to LA and he loved it. Lots of games, apps and much more. Still learning more features about this product and we love it too. Great tablet for under $100. HD quality and it works just as good as any tablet. I‚Äôm a big echo fan, so this seemed like a no brainer. I like it a lot, but I‚Äôm disappointed about google pulling YouTube functionality. I also feel like the original echo speaker sounded a little better and listened better with kitchen related background noise. The sound of the Echo Plus is good, and the matte black color looks stylish. The Phillips Hugh Bulb that was included with my purchase is nice and convenient. Added screen a great features visual effect a plus Good price. Works well. Best Buy sales associate was very helpful in selecting this product. My Dad, retired Vietnam veteran, received this as a gift and he Loves it so much. Very user friendly and great quality for the price. I am very pleased with the sound and picture quality. It does not link to direct tv. The product was for my daughter, she loves it, and plays with it all of the time. I purchased this table to use to check my email and get on Facebook, but I use it for so much more. It is a great tablet for a good price. I love this tablet/kindle. I can access email, Facebook, play simple games, shop online and read my books. Needed a tough little tablet for my grandson. Had it a couple of months and has held up very well. Bought for my granddaughter age 5 for Xmas. She loves it. I bought this and an Echo Dot just in case the Dot didn\\'t do everything I needed. The Dot worked fine, so I returned the full-featured Echo Plus. Video calls work great and the screen is super informative. It‚Äôs Alexa, but it has a screen, and it sounds pretty decent for a countertop device. My wife loves having it in the kitchen for recipes, weather music and fun! I have ordered a couple of these for my family members and say that they work great and do everything that they are supposed too. Highly recommend. Worked as advertised - easy to set up and link to my wi-fi. Great sound for the money. Easy to set up also have a dot that I like I bought this one for a family member because I loved mine so much! She was very pleased. its a lot of fun playing with alexa comands the speakers sound great. i\\'m glad i purchase it. I bought this tablet right after Black Friday. It had good reviews, a perfect warranty for kids, and a reputable branding. Once set up, it has a good cover that is light and hard for a child to remove. The included one year software Freetime is user friendly and convenient to navigate. So far, we really like this tablet. The only thing that I still need time to determine its battery life. After about 2 hours of game play, the battery is about at 50%. Very satisfied. The only draw back to this device is no internet service included. My 1 year old granddaugther loves hers and I don\\'t leave home without it. Great product... easy to use! Compatible with everything I want to use it for. Need to definitely get a memory card. Not enough memory to hold kids apps. I purchased my Eco for the holidays. It took me considerable time to get minimally operational. It is rather complex to hook up to other devises. So far it is only hooked up to my Dot. I wish there were more varieties of ways to learn how to use it. I am not nearly able to make use of it yet. But...it does look exciting if I ever get there. Thanks for the display version of Alexa - I love this model. I bought this for my finance.i bought it for Christmas he left bed it Nice to have .good thing to used love to . Would tell people about Purchased this a couple of weeks ago, no complaints so far. Web pages load pretty quickly on the Silk browser, and the battery life is excellent. After installing Google Play Store (it\\'s really easy!) even more apps are available. Can\\'t beat this for under a hundred dollars!!! Plug n play, easy to use. Speakers are good for music. If you want to control your light, tv..ect with just your voice Alexa can do that and much more We only use it for streaming Hulu and playing a few games but it\\'s held its own so far. I have been using the paperwhite for about 2 years now and this unit definitely beats it. The adaptive lighting is amazing and page turn buttons are quite useful. If you are looking for an E-Reader then this is the one for you. Got it for the kids and they love it. I am also a prime member as well there are so many great things for members, movies, apps, games and shows that are free. If you are looking for a simple tablet to help occupy some free time look into one. Wife loves it! Great sound, great technology! Compact and durable. Quite an upgrade from the original Fire. The deletion of the carousel was a welcome change. The new turn style approach is faster and more consice. Still don\\'t know why a chime sounds? Also miss the ease of making notes while reading. There has got to be a better way to organize books. Trying to figure out series, trilogies etc. Is impossible, and if you buy a series in a set then the chances are good that Amazon won\\'t pick up a new purchase as a book already read. I love the fact that I can just use my voice to use my electronic devices. My son loves it. It is easy for him to use. He doesn\\'t want to put it down. The Kindle voyager is absolutely a best product for reading ebooks. The product is easy to read in all types of light. I also like the ability to get word definitions and the expansion or text ability. Alexa items are easy to use and set up. Works easily with the smart plug and bulb. My other daughter has this same tablet, so I knew it would be a winner with my other child as well. Alexa ricks the plus is the best ever buy it you will love it I bought this for my wife for Christmas and she loves it! You can\\'t beat it for the price! Got this for my 2 year old granddaughter for Christmas. She plays on it till we have to recharge it! She loves it! Great little tablet with a host of capabilities. This device is seriously cool. The basic functions out of the box are nice, but some customization and configuration allow you to do so much more. My family loves the ability to play Amazon music with their voice. Smart home integration is a big draw! Easy to navigate. Daughter loves it. It\\'s lightweigh and its just what she needed for this avid reader. Wife loves this thing. She reads nonstop on it. She can\\'t put it down Very satisfied with my tablet ,it is very easy to operate. fits easily into my purse or bag. small compact!!! My son uses this tablet for movies and music and to surf the internet. For the money it has been fantastic. I bought this kindle for my dad. The size is just perfect, not too big nor too small, and light to carry around. We replaced our old echo for this one with a smart hub, works great I read the online reviews and compared products. Same price here as on Amazon. Easy to use and teach my granddaughter not easily breakable My son loves his kindle fire. He uses it every day. Love the many features ! Highly recommend it! using the echo saves me lots of unnecessary work... and that‚Äôs amazing! Great product. I use it everyday. It‚Äôs a great way to automate your home Using the Kindle to read books and stream videos is very easy and enjoyable. I can download my pdf file and read in this kindle. I am satisfied with the performance. Bought my 5 daughters each one for Christmas & one for myself .. love the concept I have the spot, dot and two shows, I started out with the spot and loved it so much I wanted a bigger one. This was a (Best Buy) ! No pun intended lol This is a good tablet for my son to use to play his games. I bought this device for my girlfriend to use in the kitchen so she could look up and see recipes and instructions when trying new food dishes. The device is great for this. We also love being able to listen to music, world news, search for items or products and easily order items from this device. We also are able to connect other devices and operate lights in the home. It does so much more. I think this is a great device for the home. purchased for my mother-in-law for Mothers Day, she is not a computer person, the ease of use was great for her!!! just touch the pic!! This is our 2nd one, my wife was using my most of the time, so I got her one. We bought the two-for deal as presents. My mother will have a learning curve, but since the other one is going to my son, he can teach her! Looks like a neat appliance, but want to see if it can do more than weather, music and turning off the lights... I purchased this as a gift and I\\'m had I did. This tablet far exceeds my expectations. I love this device! Perfect size for my bad eyesight! Lol! I use it all the time! One down side is the .battery life is not great! Great tablet but apps limited comparison of other tablets. This was a present for my mother, very fun! She loves looking things up and it\\'s easier to talk it out. I bought it for my family and everyone loves it! Definitely recommend buying one! So much better than reading on an iPad, completely worth it. I guess my only complaint is the operating system still seems a little weak in terms of responsiveness and fluidity but doesn\\'t really impact regular usage of just page turning, only felt while browsing the library/store etc. Love the tablet, not only for reading (upgrade from Kindle) but for searching the Internet, email, etc. And I can take it anywhere. Cheaper than an iPAD and does enough for what I need. I bought this for my elderly parents that refuse to get a smart phone.They loved it, and feel safer with it. I programmed it to call 911 if they fall and need help. Plus they can see the grand children without any confusion. One of my favorite gadgets. It can do so .any things. I bought this for my business to monitor the arlo security cameras and it is amazing! It has such a BIG screen to see better. It loads games and books very fast! Bought this for my wife. She is a constant reader and put away her previous Kindles for this one. She now has internet access also, so she can find more books anytime she wants. I like how it has the screen but I do like the echo plus better. Both gets the job done Second kindle I use it for reading,games,internet,and shopping This is awesome and the sound is amazing, the screen is outstanding Purchased this item for our daughter. She absolutely loves it! This was a gift for my wife and she loves it!! It is much better than the old one My son\\'s love there tablet. Great but for the price Good for leisure/reading for fun. Not for students. Great size. Works with all apps. No issues yet. Would buy more. my third amazon fire, has more features than my old one. battery lastlonger It works pretty well. I wish there\\'s was an instruction book with it instead of having to go online. Plus I didn\\'t know you had to pay for music and it doesn\\'t listen very well like it said it would. I am extremely satisfied with my purchase.New toy! If you are looking for something to help you keep more organized or keep you up to date with weather, markets, and the latest news the Amazon Echo Show is what you are looking for. Honestly, the product is top of the line technology, and is easy to use as long you are patient and work with it, and read the directions. The size of it is truly perfect; it honestly reminds me of the size of normal alarm clock that would have on a nightstand, and with that it truly can serve that purpose. It also has a touch screen, and I feel it is very durable and can stand to last. The sound quality is also superb, with dual 2-inch speakers. It has Bluetooth capabilities as well, but it only works with android, Samsung, Fire OS, IOS device, excluding Mac products. The Echo Show comes in two colors black and white. The product has many different features and functions, and they can accommodate pretty much anyone‚Äôs needs. The top feature is the Alexa App, which is an application in which you can call commands and ask it questions about most anything. Then I believe the music capabilities are truly amazing and how you can ask it to play almost any song or playlist whenever you want. Also you can tell it to volume up or down as well. Another new modernized technology it has is the capability to do hands free voice command Smart Home options. A couple things that could be improved, is sometimes that it does not fully hear your exact words, and it will search for something you aren‚Äôt expecting. The other function it could have is it could have single voice recognition to only several voices, so then you don‚Äôt have the entire room trying to mess with it constantly. The price is also fair as well, for its creative capabilities it has. So if you are trying to find some new technology to add to your home the Echo Show would be a great addition for you. Bought for my parents, they love it. Easy to use and setup I bought this for learning and entertaining purposes. My daughter is 5 & enjoys it. I compared this to other learning tablets and found for the price & protection plan this works best for us. I like the display with news. Found out a command to turn off screen which was bright at night. I haven\\'t used for movies etc. but that should be fairly simple. Sound is decent and picture quality is not bad too. I bought with $100 discount on two. Serves its purpose for the price. Would much rather have the iPad for ease of use, but it is well protected and good my my toddler to play with and not make me worry about it being broken. This is the best purchase I\\'ve mad in a tablet my daughter loves it BUY IT !The video adds great value to the songs, news, etc.Also, accessing videos such as Netflix adds greatly. Owned a kindle fire HDX for GameCircle years. Finally decided Goodreads upgrade. This fire HD 8 is great. Really Prime the larger screen and new features. We had heard a lot about the Echo Plus and had seen the commercials. We have not been disappointed as Alexa is a welcomed family member already !!! We Love Her !!! So much fun, love it........................................................... It syncs with my Echo, displays slideshows, recipes, and lists, controls my Fire Stick, and sounds pretty good. It doesn\\'t play You Tube videos but it does do a good job playing videos. I have multiple Echo devices so purchasing another was a no brainer. I enjoy this one as it is video capable. The only thing I wish they would add was a way to pivot the camera and or improve its low light capabilities for poorly lite rooms. working well and very cheap if we think in the price way I HAVE BEEN WITH AMAZON PRIME FOR 2 YEARS AND THIS NEW FIRE HD MAKES IT WORTH IT. i WATCH MOVIES WHEN I FLY BECAUSE I CAN DOWNLOAD THEM. THE BATTERY LAST FOR DAYS. I USE IT EVERYDAY NOW. I bought this for my husband who is in a nursing home to be able to listen to music.. He loves it... And uses it every day for music and other things too. She loves it, plays with it everyday all day. Thanks The video is pretty good and the speaker is better than I thought it would be. Great tablet, not for the power user. Average users will find everything they need. Nice size screen, clear and clean picture with plenty of storage Purchased this tablet for a gift..They love it. Easy to use. Purchased this for 6 year old boy and couldn\\'t be happier My 3 1/2 year old grandson son LOVES this \"big game\" as he calls it. Love this tablet! This is my second. Just couldn\\'t beat the price!! It\\'s awesome. Feels like \"company.\" Takes commands on the first try and the sound fills the room beautifully! My guests love it too! I bought the echo show for my mom for her birthday and she loves it! We use it all the time. I love my kindle. It fast, great pict quality and is so convenient to use. I love using it to watch Netflix. It worth the purchase if you don\\'t want to spend so much money. My grandaughter is enjoying this tablet. I would recommend to all parents for their young kids. The Amazon Show is a great addition to the Smart Home, easy to set up and to link up with a hub. A viable substitute for the more expensive I Pad especially for kids wanting a tablet. You can download books, games, email and access the internet. Parental controls are easily enabled. If you want to read anytime where there\\'s a light source this is thereafter for you. If you do a lot of night reading the paper white is cheaper considering the add kns you will have to buy for the base model. Excellent addition to our Amazon components. It is especially better than other versions at hearing varying voices and responding to commands. This is an awesome product. This is the first Echo product I owned and I purchased 2 to get $100 off. I was going to split with a friend but like this so much that I decided to keep both. I\\'ve being singing along with the stream song with lyrics while doing work in the kitchen and house and watching youtube videos. The videos on Youtube takes a more effort to find the ones I want but I think this will improve over time. My family Loves this. My 3 boys love asking alexa to tell a joke, or to make toot noises. It\\'s super helpful in with news and weather updates. Nice tablet for the price. Being amazon prime member, I am using many amazon services and devices, tablet is really handy for managing it all very easily apart from other basic functinality of tablets. I am very satisfied with my purchase my girlfriend is very happy Great help from assistants in the store. They were very knowledgeable and took the time to help me choose the right product for my needs. It is still the best device for buying books and reading them. However, go with kindle paperwhite if you read books in dark places. Does everything I need and has a long battery life. My daughter loves playing with this. There are so many features, that it keeps her busy. Most speaker like this will be over USD150.00 but this one is less than that price with a great sound quality I bought this tablet for my son, he loves it. He used to look up everything on his smartphone, and watched Netflix on it too, but this tablet beats it with speed and overall performance. It also takes really good pictures. Every member of my family owns one of the Kindle Fire tablets. Very neat item, fun to talk to. Easy set up to use. Love the color just the right size easy to set up works well for what I needed it for great price Great device for me because I already owned bunch of stuff that supports Alexa. Needs more skills. And need YouTube to work! I\\'ve purchased other kids tablets, but this is the best. It\\'s user friendly and interactive. My grandson carries it with him where ever he goes. Great hardware for the price, similar to the ipads I have not used this as it is a gift for my parents. Will see how they like it. Bought for Christmas for 6 and 8 year old granddaughters. Both girls loved it and have said it was their favorite gift. This is a kid friendly tablet good for gaming and learning games as well. Glad we got it. Display is great for doing video calls with others with echo show. Works well with home automation devices. Sound is great for listening to music. Easy to set up and durable grandpa dropped it and no issues Works well. Haven\\'t been able to work out the local traffic yet. I bought the Echo Show because a friend of mine was excited about his. I\\'m hoping it makes a great Christmas present for our family. I needed a device to listen to books on a long drive. This paired easily in the car and downloading the audible books was a snap. everything was as I expected.... and order it online and pick it up next day... easy to do... This is a newer version of the Fire I had previously and I love it. I like the camera. This version is lighter than the other. It is taking me a while to learn the differences but most of them are improvements. Great accessory for Alexis system..helpful and fun battery seems to die fast, but that is my only complaint. Amazon fire tablet is great and easy to use. Good value! I use it daily to check emails, social media and recipes. Love the simplicity. Also love that I use it for reading only and can\\'t download distracting apps. Not to big, not to small. Just right for for taking your movies and music on the go. I bought this to go with my Amazon Prime membership. Popped in a 128 Gb mini sd card for plenty of storage. This device is a nice starter tablet for kids. The Fire OS with Freetime Unlimited (free for 1 year) is an excellent environment. The warranty is great, and had we kept the device I\\'m sure we would have had the opportunity to use it. However, the device we received in the \"Kids Edition\" box was not registered as a \"Kids Edition\" with Amazon, thus the FreetimeUnlimited plan only lasted 30 days and the \"Kids Edition\" warranty did not apply. Amazon could not register the Fire as a \"Kids Edition\" so it was returned. I love my kindle fire. Its a great reading device. I purchased the Kindle Fire 8\" after owning a 7\" for several years. I love the bigger screen and added features in this version. I love my Echo Show. It is easy to use and being an Amazon Prime member I can play all my songs. I cook dinner listening to music. I also linked my SiriusXM to it so i can listen to my favorite music. It is so easy to use my 80 year old mother wantwd one. Great product. Device performed as described. Great reviews. I love my new Kindle. The size is perfect. It fits right in my purse. Easy to navigate and I love the touch screen. I am able to read outside without a glare. Only flaw is that it is not backlit, so in order to read in the dark I need a book light. I don\\'t mind that so much, I just wish kindle would come out with a case for this Kindle with a built in book light like they did for the first generation Kindle. The kindle is great not only is it a reader its bascially a computer. It connects to the internet it takes pictures and has many other great features. Great product fun to use. Very easy to set up and begin useing This Amazon Echo is very user friendly, and provides hours of entertainment, with anything from recipes, news, videos, and Amazon music with the lyrics is like having your own Karaoke. The Echo Show is a game changer, it\\'s amazing as are all the Echo\\'s but with this one you can watch video\\'s, or see who\\'s at your door. The things that Echo can do are limitless, it\\'s like having a personal assistant. Love this combination package I got while on sale. Amazon Echo Plus is responsive and easy to use. Great sound quality. Easy to integrate with other services such as the Hue Bulb. Just need to get more bulbs to complete my setup. This was an awesome gift for someone very special and they enjoy it as much as I do mine would recommend product Great little tablet after you add google play store. Takes some research to do. This make an excellent ebook reader. Don\\'t expect much from this device except to read basic ebooks. The good thing is it\\'s cheap and good to read in the sun. Purchased for book reading but works well as a tablet. Wasn\\'t thinking that it would be a full replacement for my old IPad but working well as one. This is a great tablet. My grandson uses it to watch his cartoons. We also have ABC Mouse that he uses on it. It\\'s very durable and he loves it!! My kids love their tablets. They play games and take pictures. got this for my kindle 7 tablet . Does an excellent job charging the kindle fire 7 a lot faster than the one it came with the kindle fire The Echo Show device connects with a range of services, including Amazon Music to expand your experience. Ask questions and see the answers with the Echo Show, which connects to Alexa for an immersive search experience. Really good for KIDS use kids lock so they don\\'t see what the don\\'t suppose to see love this Sales guy didn\\'t have much knowledge about the Kindle. He wasn\\'t very helpful in getting me started. I bought two of these for my two grandchildren. (A 4 year old boy and a 2 year old girl) So, I bought one in pink and one in blue. We down loaded age appropriate games and they are lifesavers! my son loves his tablet! best if you buy some amazon gift credit for some games and apps. My husband loves this Kindle. He has a muscular disease keeping him from being able to handle anything with much weight at all. This is perfect. Moving to this from the first generation Paperwhite appears to have been the right move. I love the new size, it just feels tiny and perfect in the hand. The new automatic brightness setting works quite well. I do wish I could crank up the force required to activate the page turn buttons however, as I have frequently hit them accidentally. The page turn buttons do work with gloves on which a great for reading in a tree stand. I bought this as a gift and the recipient loves the processing speed and the fact that it has 2 cameras on the device. Purchased as a gift for my 14 year old son. He absolutely loves it. Uses to place music, ask questions and turn off his lights! I purchased this, in addition to several other Alexa products, because I wanted the hub to connect several smart home devices. So far it has been pretty easy to set up and use. I\\'m happy with the sound also. A friend recommended the tablet and I am happy with it. Second purchase of Echo Show. Love the device and all of it\\'s features. Used primarily for communication with my 90 yo mother. I drop in, there\\'s nothing for her to do but talk and smile :) I use the Alexa app on my phone with mom (which works very well and still use when mobile) but I got this one for ease at home. I bought this for my sister as a gift so she need not use her laptop for basic internet surfing and to watch movies while travelling. The device speed is decent although you cannot compare the performance to a laptop. If you want to avoid carrying a bulky laptop during travel and want a budget make do device for laptop then choose amazon fire tablet. Very easy to use tablet. Lots of apps and game available. This Kindle is alot larger and better for viewing. Great tablet for under $100. Does not have the highest specs, but gets the job done for lite tablet users. I bought this tablet as a 13th birthday present for my niece. She loves it and takes it everywhere. She reads books and watches Netflix just to name a few things you can do with this tablet. Got this when it was on sale mainly to get the books not available @ B&N and to play audiobooks. Main drawback: the constant advertising! You turn it on and get a ad. Let it sit for a moment or two, another ad pops up. Ads for nothing I\\'ve ever expressed an interest in. Very irritating.Color is very crisp and clean.Love my older Nook but lately B&N doesn\\'t always have the books that are available on Amazon. Will continue to use the Nook as my primary e-reader with the Fire as my primary audiobook player. purchased for 4 yr old, he loves it the fact he can play games or movies, love the parental controls as I am able to monitor how much he is on it. Works great for my grandson - had the Geek squad get a security plan setup on it and him acquainted with it. Battery life not great, but with a bright 10 inch screen on a THIN tablet is not surprising. Once you have it, you can\\'t live without it. Great product. Easy to set up, great picture love it! Keeps my kids entertained and they love it also ....it was a gift. Is better than face time when calling my kid, since they have one, IÔ∏è could call them from my and see them at the same time, perfect for cooking timer n best for music My son is 4 and he loves it. Super easy to use for kids. Love my Kindle Voyage. The size is much smaller than my older Kindle and the weight is much less. This helps as I take fm Kindle everywhere. Love the touch screen features. It\\'s a lot of fun. To fully enjoy it, we had to get Amazon music unlimited. We bought four of them, so we can keep in touch with family. Alexa is very entertaining! He loves it. Helps him learn and teaches him how to count I purchase 2 on Super Bowl Sunday for my 5 & 7 year old birthday. It was the perfect gift, because the 2 love their gift. The tablets was for a girl and a boy, so I purchase a pink & a blue. The tablet is very child proof. Easy set up, simple to use, and lots of fun! Alexa can tell you the weather forecast, play any music you‚Äôd like to hear, read you recipes and so much more! Great product Works great!! Would recommend for anyone looking for a good product. Very kid friendly! This met my expectations and more. My granddaughter loves it. It\\'s user friendly and has unlimited options for her. Would recommend to everyone! Easy to hold, access to some free games - just be careful if you have 1-click payment option. My 3 year old charged $16 to my account in 3 days. Good news - I received emails about the purchases and was able to get help in stopping the process from happening too often. She loves the \"FIRE\" It\\'s pretty cool. Integration with Amazon Music via the mobile phone interface is a little iffy which is odd given both products come from the same company. The 8\" version is much better than the older 7\" version. Better graphics and faster processor My son is very happy with this and so are mommy and daddy. No more asking for our phones and setting the time limit is awesome It\\'s a great eReader and the font is much clearer than that of the Paperwhite, but that may not be enough to justify the extra $$$. The page turn buttons are a great addition too.Would be good if Amazon would add audiobook capability though. My husband is up in years & really enjoys spending time on his Kindle. He had a smaller one & it gave out on him so this one is ideal. He spends hours on it & has hours of fun!!! I purchased this tablet for my 4 year old daughter and its FANTASTIC! Its durable and very user friendly! Love all all the free educational games, movies & books! My son love it. He watch his favorite cartoon shows and love to read books For the most part I like the tablet. Got it for my mother. The con is you have to use Amazon for apps. Like it so much I gave them out as gifts for Christmas I bought this as a gift and it has performed perfectly. Can\\'t beat at this price. I read reviews for all the Amazon echo products, and decided the portability and the full size of the Tap made it the right product for me. It lives up to my expectations. It does last all day, playing music, answering questions, (although my accent must give it some problems as I get a few \"I didn\\'t understand that\" comments from Alexa), and setting timers/alarms and lists. I picked the Tap because it has the ability to be moved room to room or even to the patio, and can be recharged overnight. Very fast and super easy to use I\\'m very pleased with this purchase!! This was a gift for my girlfriend. She loved due to the fact that it was small and compacted .. Does everything we wanted. Great value for the price. Easy to use. Should have bought this a long time ago. Easy set up and amazing usefulness, love it. I use it all the time and continue to find new ways to take advantage of all there is within Alexa. Will purchase another one for bedroom! Granddaughter loves it these was her upgrade for her birthday I\\'ve had an Amazon Echo and Dot for over a year now. I really wanted to develop the Smart Device usage around my house and when the upgraded Echo i just had to have it. It is a great device. I use the drop in feature to communicate with others in the house, especially when they are upstairs, without having to yell. The smart hub is amazing. Attaching to smart devices is much more seamless than with the 1st gen echo. Just got it so time will tell, but the 2nd gen Echo devices are worth it. This is a great tablet for the money. It works for what I need it for; checking emails, downloading books and magazines. Great price and very lightweight. I was able to Facebook Messenger my sister who lives in Alaska, which is something I had not been able to do with my phone or my laptop. So I am happy. Bought it on black Friday for 60$ .Value for money tablet. It lags at heavy tasks and also apps are reloaded when 2-3 apps are opened at same time. But at this price it is expected. Go for it if budget is <100$. This Alexa series 2 sounds better and preforms better than the previous model. It picks up the voices 10x better and the sound quality is on a Bose level(fills the whole room). Me and my family spends more quality time on the product! Good and fast for kids does have very good control of parents on that The Fire tablet is great, we just bought our second. It\\'s screen is pleanty big enough to see, but small enough to fit in my jacket pocket. Got this on sale for a great price and is a great product. Quite light, easy to conceal, easy to use and quite quick. the best feature of this Kindle is the page forward/back buttons which allow you to turn pages without taking hards off the unit. The Amazon Echo Show is a great addition to any connected home. Allows me to link Phillips Hue and Nest systems to control with voice. Great display and available information is awesome. Great..I love it..Glad I got it..My nephew loves it. I bought it as the display for my Echo. Turning on Voicecast routes information to the tablet with the voice reaponse. It\\'S been exactly what I hoped it would be and the price was right. Love listening to music and having it turn my light on and off I bought this for my daughter. She loves it. She reads books and plays games. My stepkids are pretty rough on their toys and these have lasted pretty darn well so far. Easy to update and add games, apps and school related material. Go for it if you are looking for a pretty darn decent tablet for the lil ones this is pretty cool, we love ours, we listen to music and the sound is great, my kids are always asking her questions, we can call on it, set reminers, timers and alarms for us it was worth the price but one thing I dont like is that it nickles and dimes you, like even though I have a prime membership, all music is not available , I had to pay to upgrade to be able to listen to everything and it doesnt stop there, even though I upgraded it ,if you purchased the dots not everyone can play music at the same time, to do that youll have to pay to upgrade again. but even so I dont regret this purchase and the whole family enjoys it. I bought two of these as a birthday gift for my niece and nephew. They absolutely love them. They use it all the time to play games and music. Great deal, great price LOVE ITL:) This was bought as a replacement to a shattered screen kindle. We are always happy with our kindle but can i just tell you how easy it was to set up the replacement!?!? Literally no strain on the brain, follow screen instructions and EVERYTHING from old kindle transferred over flawlessly! Awesome! Good product for a young child to play with without breaking this a great tablet, my grandaughter uses the kindle settings for her little girl who is in pre school It‚Äôs my first Alexa and I love it nice sound and smart light acts fast with command This device is especially useful if you know others who own it. It offers the same features as the standard Echo, along with an expanded feature set as well. I love my new Amazon Fire tablet it\\'s great!! The perfect size to fit in my purse so that I can take it with me. I would definitely recommend to a friend. I love my kindle fire it\\'s is good for watching movies reading and anything you need a tablet for. It\\'s exactly what you\\'d think it would be. No more, no less...a perfect e-reader for traveling and backpacking. My wife like to play games and the 16g is much better and faster fo this. Nice way to see the internet and also to view security cameras. Very handy device. I love my Fire and the fact that I now have a place for my \"library\" that\\'s not taking up space on my phone. Great starter eReader, very simply does what it\\'s made to do. This tablet is great for small kids because it is well protected and is preloaded with many games.Adults can also use it when required.You have to be careful what mode your in as your child may start trying to buy stuff on you! This product is great. Still finding out everything that it can do, but completely satisfied. Great product and great service from bestbuy online I usually unplug it but when I plug it back in, it is always difficult to get it reconnected to the internet for some reason. Purchased for my son who loves to read books. Saw him watching old TV show. He sat down with me and showed me what all it could do. Who would figure. I thought it was just for reading books. Now I want one too! Alexa controls my lights, TV and sound system. Very happy with this. I so love my Amazon fire tabletYou have.everything you want books, games etc. The picture are so clear and beautiful. I can\\'t keep my son off of it . I\\'m thinking about getting another for him .He love watching videos of his favorite show What a neat gadget. I thought I loved my echo dot n this is so much more. I like that u can video chat with other people who own it also. The kids love it I like that it is a good reader and that you can also put some apps on it -- I use it to check email, one note, etc. but primarily as a reader. I purchased two for my grandchildren. They loved it. Reading, games and videos My mom loves the kindle fire hd 8. She had the first kindle and it was time for an upgrade! Great buy for her birthday present!! Great to give as gifts. I bought several items for staff. Bought an IPad and didn\\'t like it. Returned it and got the Fire 10.1. This is my third Fire, love it....no.learning curve. If you really want to have a good read on something digital this is the item you\\'re looking for. It really is lightweight and highly functional. The battery lasts a long time and the screen is easy on the eyes. The only difficulty sometimes is reading in extremely bright environments. Overall an excellent buy. I have no issues with product. Daughter seems to love it I use to communicate with family. I love the drop in feature and it‚Äôs much easier to hear everyone as opposed to FaceTime on speakerphone. It has more to offer, but that is enough for me to recommend for anyone who uses video to keep in touch. Easy, fast and efficient.great lil tablet in this price range for anyone. This product worked very well and very easy to use. We purchased 2 ... one for each grandson so they can watch movies and play games. Like the parental controls. That was very important to us. Bought this table for my 4 and 9 year old for Christmas. They love them! Got this for the kids for Xmas...was the BEST gift. Tablet met all her needs! She loves it! Great purchase A little more complicated than my original kindle, but I lIke it. amazon tablet is great. no google bloatware. everything is amazon. one thing i didnt like was. ads on the lock screen and no way to turn off. Fits nicely in your hand and its touchable. increase the size of the fonts Used it for watching television shows. The picture was clear and the audio was decent for the location of the speakers. I have a previous version of the Kindle, but this one surpasses it in every way, from the resolution to the automatic brightness display. Recommend it highly. great tablet for kids with amazon bonuses. don\\'t have to worry about what content my kid is accessing. This tablet is designed primarily to sell, distribute and store media purchased from the Amazon.com product line, ie Kindle e-books, movies viewed or stored from their online movie streaming service, etc., and it does that very well.Reasonably sharp screen, good sound, good battery life and decent component materials. It uses their version of the Android OS which they call the Fire OS which is decently responsive and fairly intuitive to use - Be aware that you cannot install or run most apps purchased from the Google Play store, but must rely on Amazon\\'s own app store which is decent, but not as extensive as either Apple\\'s or Google\\'s. I saw there was a new Echo with a screen and had to have it. I use it for Amazon Prime videos, YouTube, music with lyrics, recipes, and viewing the nursery with Amazon Cloud cam. The speaker is louder than I thought. Good purchase but I‚Äôd like to see more features for the screen. Between this product and Siri, AlexaIs much more useful and reliable. It controls many things in my home and is very dependable. Only one problem... commercials activate Alexa when it hears them. This is my second Kindle and I love it! It\\'s so convenient to be able to carry around hundreds of books without the bulk and weight of literally carrying around hundreds of books. I just wish I could have bought accessories at Best Buy. Also, the sales rep knew nothing about the devices and had to \\'Goggle\\' info on her phone. This size holds more apps and content. It\\'s pretty lightweight too. I have several Kindles so knew what to expect. It is a great reading device and I keep several in different locations. Good product, great price. Big improvement over my first tablet. It is a great tablet believe it or not it is also great for kids use parental controls. This tablet is small, compact and easy to handle. It\\'s easy to figure out the main functions. My one complaint is that it does not support some big apps such as Dropbox or Google Drive. Great device. Good speaker, very solid feeling. Microphones listen well. I really liked the many facets of the Tablet. Presence of Alexa does provide opportunity for Adults to play and surprise by it.The only caveat is Amazon Free Time is for only 1 Year which Amazon should increase by atleast 1 year for Prime Members but thats more of service and no complains on Tablet. Still learning what all she can do but it definitely makes life easier. I had reservations for the purchase of this Echo show, they quickly eroded after setting it up and using it now since Christmas day. Everyone in my family loves the camera function, sound quality, picture resolution and basically everything about it!It isn\\'t totally perfected yet but it is a work in progress when it comes to the skills and how you choose to use this device since it is definitely designed for Amazon and their customers. Versatile enough so that everyone could find something to enjoy from music, pictures, videos to having your favorite book read to you. One of my favorite features are the Ole time radio series offered in the skills. Takes you back in time as you relax and very similar to a good book. Just my preference and it does offer much more and new skills are daily being added. Although we have several echo dots everywhere, my 6yo loves to come to the echo show to hear her music or to see new pictures uploaded to our cloud. The sound is amazing for its size, that\\'s a huge plus. Pictures are dynamic and so far the only issue with me anyway is it\\'s shape. Slightly odd but it seems to blend into our decor pretty well. Hopefully newer and even better skills will be made as this is a real gem in the rough with tons of applications still ahead that it can be used for. I have it connected to our home security system, robot vacuum cleaner and at times to my cell phone. Taken all together it is useful, fun and a nice addition for our gadget loaded home. Mom likes this allot, once she started using it. She was hesitant at first because it\\'s something new! But that didn\\'t last long. Am happy with my purchase and the item is being used by my brother\\'s son and he is also happy as on dat Bought this for my mom. She thinks it\\'s great. It is easy to use and hooked right up to all her previously owned items. Easy to set up. Good size tablet. Like the addition of Alexa My order came on time and great price. This item is a gift for a family member. Definitely recommend to anyone that wants a exciting product I will recommend for other parents to buy this product I\\'ve love kindles for years and was looking for a bit larger reading area. That is what I got and more. I very satisfied EXCEPT it just goes blank repeatedly and for no apparent reason stay on and I am back to satisfaction. I have really enjoyed my Tap. Alexa responds well and I love the charging dock on my desk. The only downside is the app used for setup is not very good. This is a superb tablet for the price. It doesn\\'t come with the Android operating system. It has Amazon\\'s operating system. The battery last a good long time and apps run very fast. I would recommend this to anyone who wants a tablet. i have had not issues with my purchase. i found a great cover for it on line on amazon and use it every night. thank you for your service. Bought this tablet cause it was super cheap during December. It\\'s a good tablet for someone who doesn\\'t need a powerhouse i loved this product so much i have bought four of them for christmas gifts Very nice Kindle with a great Battery life. My old kindle was not able to upgrade so I got the new Kindle and very pleased with the product. Arrived as promised from BESTBUY.COM. super cool very interesting i have a lot of fun with it Wanted something with a kids mode on it so we could limit time and content. This works. Saw it for a really low price so couldn\\'t resist otherwise we would have gotten the padded kids version. I love my kindle, I can listen to music,read my emails, or pick a book to read. Everything loads up easily. This is such a wonderful value for the money!!Clear display with great color!! I wanted this when I first heard about it. My husband surprised me for my birthday. It was the best gift. Love Love it I have a 3 year old at home. Best purchase ever! Indestructible. Reliable. Easy to program. I would highly recommend this. I gave this to my 6-year old for Christmas and it has been the perfect gift. Great price point (compared to an ipad) that can function for exactly what she needs. The amazon echo plus has worked great. We like the smart bulb with the echo. I think these products are great. I enjoy using them. This is my first kindle but I\\'m loving it. I picked it up a few days after it was released. One of the things I love the most is I\\'m a reader but I am not a car owner so I get almost everywhere by bike. I got tired of lugging around heavy hardcover books from the library; now my Voyage weighs less than most paperback books. An extra bonus for me is, it fits in a pocket I wasn\\'t using in my pannier I carry stuff to work everyday. I love the clarity of the text and pressure point page turning versus screen swipes. I also love that I charged it when I got 4 days ago and it is still more than have battery power. We bought 2 of them and love them. The screen is really clear and the sound is amazing. Go get one Fantastic tablet fire one is great. Small and portable The amazon Show has to be one of the best smart home devices that every came out. Alexa, Videos, music, and drop in. Amazing product!!! Love my kindle! At the price it is the best value in tech right now! I‚Äôm pretty impressed with the technology. It‚Äôs a little annoying having to say Alexa all the time. I‚Äôve purchases the links for the outlets and that‚Äôs all it‚Äôs really good for since the bulbs were too dim for me. My husband and I purchased 3 of these for each of our kiddos and to say they\\'re a hit would be a massive understatement. And the parental controls on these are awesome. We love our new Fires!! Great product and reasonable price! Suitable for everyday use I couldn\\'t believe how easy and fast the setup was. It\\'s basically plug and play. I watched a video first and it took no more than 3 minutes to get going. You don\\'t need any other equipment to set it up. The sound is unbelievable...better than my Bose. It is very simple to start up and use. Great for all ages and experience on using tablets. My entire family enjoyed all of the purchases we from the store The Apple Watch is great. I am very happy with the purchase. We love this speaker for listening to music, the weather, news, or just anything. It is super portable and even has a hands-free option so it is really like a mini Echo! I bought this kindle for my 11yr old granddaughter for Christmas. Me and my husband both had kindles several years prior, and she and my 6 year old grandson love watching and playing on them. Both children have all kinds of game systems but use the kindle way more. My 6 yr old grandson still plays with mine and loves watching you tube, videos and playing games on it. He has several game systems, Xbox, sega, ds but still uses my kindle all the time over those systems.my husband used his all the time for everything from internet to watching movies and shows. I\\'m getting ready to buy my grandson a new kindle( mine is a bit older and has cracked screen now but still works good).He would like one to call his own. I\\'m looking at a 16 GB or 32 GB.they are really durable and tough. For the price this is an excellent tablet. I have a high end laptop that does convert to tablet but at almost 16\" and the foldover design I normally just use it in laptop mode. I also have a high end \"phablet\" sized phone. So I was not sure how often I\\'d use a tablet, and did not want to spend 500ish on an ipad. The Fire has been a great \"in between\" so far on days I use my phone alot and want to avoid charging more than once per day, and don\\'t have the need to use my laptop. The speed is zippy & the screen clarity/quality is good enough. Storage is even better than ipads since it is expandable (for now I use a 64 gb card giving me a total of 96 gb, but the expandable can go up to 200 gb). Tying into Amazon is nice since I have Amazon Prime). Basic web surfing, email & facebook work great. The only \"bad\" feature is the camera & video quality. But that does not matter to me since I have my high quality camera & video recorder on my phone. Only other slight negative is light bleed noticed just when booting up on grey screen. Color/brightness uniformity is perfect to my eyes once it is up & running. Really enjoying the kindle component for book & magazine reading as well. Overall, probably the best $100 I have spent in a long time. After researching and reading endless reviews, I bought myself an early Christmas present in the Amazon Echo Show. Once I had it home, it was quickly set up and has been a joy to have since day one. Loved it so much I bought two more as gifts. So enjoying being able to see friends and family on a more regular basis with the video option. I‚Äôm sure as I learn more this will become even more useful. Great addition to my other Echo devices. I found that I was immediately sked by a staff member if I needed help. I received good advice and shown similar alternative products. What I bought was perfect for what I wanted. The price was quite reasonable. Bought 2 of these for my 6 and 8 yr old and it said it came with 32gb storage but actual storage was a little less, cant remember exactly how much probably around 20gb with the other necessary programs that come already pre-installed. They mainly use it for games and have downloaded many games on them. There is room for external storage and it also has a front and rear camera. love the product. comes in different color as well. I got the blue! As I age, it\\'s difficult for me to see the smaller screens so when this one came out .... I was delighted!!! Love playing my games!!! Keeps my granddaughter busy. She was showing me how to use it. Now she doesn\\'t want to use mine. Good tablet for my baby.keeps him busy. I love it. I love the echo show. It is a personal assistant, DJ, weatherman & news person all in one. This is our second Show. We love the video qualties & the sound can\\'t be beat. It is a good reading device. When the price drop to 100 dollar, it is a deal. You need to buy one at that level. Easy access to my Amazon account. Easy to set up and use. Fun and useful, very interactive and still learning all abilities. (accidentally posted the wrong review for wrong tablet earlier)This tablet is a steal for the price. I have an old version but bought this one for my sister. You can read books, magazines, stream shows, play games, stream music, and use almost any big named app you can get on google play or apple store. It also gives you a month free of Amazon Prime which gives you so much more to do with this tablet. Honestly considering buying one myself a new one. This was an Xmas gift for my wife. She had wanted a pad of some sort but I just couldn\\'t afford an Ipad so I looked at the Fire as an alternative. First the screen size was just what I wanted. Second the price was very reasonable. Third it had functions and capabilities that were suitable for my wife\\'s skills and needs. She absolutely loves it and I actually got a compliment on my present giving. That don\\'t happen very often let me tell you. I will recommend this she\\'s pleased I\\'m pleased what else do you need?  My son was able to piggyback off of this gift, and purchased her the cover to go with it. So it really worked for my family. And I made my wife happy . Love it , it‚Äôs my second Alexa it‚Äôs conceted to everything in my house thinking about buying more love the ease of use with tablet, have not had any issues We have an iPad but bought this for the kids unlimited prime content. We have enjoyed it and it has a lot that the iPad doesn\\'t. The menu could be more friendly but I like the parental limits it has. I bought my Kindle because I heard it was good for reading in direct sunlight. I‚Äôve got a bay window I like to read at and other tablets I‚Äôve read on produce a lot of glare. This has zero glare and I can‚Äôt wait to take it camping this Spring/Summer/Fall. A side note, this is way lighter than any book (as you may have guessed). I like to read on my back and having this has drastically increased the amount of time I can read for. Makes things easy to do like listen to music, check the weather, hear the news,etc. just make sure you say ‚ÄúAlexa‚Äù loans and clear. Sometimes it doesn‚Äôt hear you. Great product, i recommend is easy to use and fast. My baby boy has one, I knew my girl would love it as well. Fun games and the AppStore has access to new games and books. Works great, good price. Would buy it again. Kids have great time with it. bought for grand kids front camera rear camera wifi ready games they caN SKYPE SO MANY THINGS you can use it for 2 YEAR NO QUETION WARENTY its your best buy bought this e-reader as a gift for my wife and she loves it It is amaizin I like the way you type and search my favorites I am so happy to have the Echo Show. I have been able to listen to Christmas songs and some country western music. It has so many other things to do with it that I can not wait to try some. I bought the tablet and it is very nice. I really like the night time mode to use before bed so you can still sleep. Has great sound, clarity,alexia has great responses We bought this for mother in law, buying another for me. I bought this for my daughter for Christmas. I could set her as a user and make it safe for her age. I downloaded books and apps with ease. I\\'m glad that she is loving her Fire. Love that I can view my arlo cams on it , love it plays movie trailers on point , love the lyrics when playing music , love the video calls, love the drop in to other Alexa devices around the house (they now work as intercoms) so I can be in the 3rd floor of my house (3 story home in Las Vegas ) the doorbell rings I can say alexa show me front door (arlo cam) then I can say alexa open front door, drop in on the echo by front door and say come on up , Just having a blast with this stuff , yes I am in deep with the smart home thing.. alexa turn on the lights (hue color lights) , turn on the fan (wemo switches) Alexa set house to 77 degrees (nest ) so endless , yeah I would say the ECHO SHOW IS A GOOD START ... This was a gift for my kids. They love them. Easy to use and lots of great apps! I like the changes that have been made since my current 4 year old unit was purchased Purchased mainly to use travelling so haven\\'t really had the opportunity to give it a fair road test at this point. It was advertised as capable of downloading movies and books so you can watch/read while travelling without burning through your data or being hit with data roaming fees or having to purchase wifi during flights. This was a great tablet for the price for my wife. Perfect size and good for traveling. Setting up the amazon show was a little tricky,but I managed to navigate through it. It‚Äôs so cool to add compatible equipment. This Alexa device is great fun, and useful for several personal assistant type applications. I use it in conjunction with some TP-Link Light switches, and it works flawlessly. It is nice to see the lyrics to songs she plays, and calling other people who have the show or spot works well. She is also really good at setting reminders and alarms. Another useful feature is as an in home intercom. This is my first tablet. So far, I am pleased with my Fire Tablet. I am not a gamer, I do basic internet searches and check e-mail. Is easier due to size, than using my smart phone. No problems or issues to this point. Very fast, very functional. Love the e-reader function. Movies, music and internet work great. LOVE IT! Great way to get kids introduced to using a tablet. A ton of free software is available. Guarantee seals the deal. Purchased as a birthday gift for grandson and he LOVES it. I have had the Echo Show for about a month now. So this review is from a new user whom has never had smart devices aside from cell phones. Alexa is great for listening to music, most of it free if you\\'re an Amazon Prime member, pair your Echo device with a bluetooth speaker for awesome sound. Alexa works well with smart home devices such as light bulbs, outlets and thermostat. (Most of these are really easy to set up, so you don\\'t have to be a very technical person.) All of which can be voice controlled or remotely via the Alexa app from your smart phone. If you have a friend with an Echo Show, you can make video calls via the devices or directly to a smart phone which is pretty awesome for family and friends whom live far away. As far as answering questions, do not expect the best answers. The Bing search engine needs some work. If you want to ask the questions she prompts you with on an Echo show, she\\'s your girl, but if you want to know something, you might have to look it up yourself. IE; weather forecast, you get whatever Bing uses and the short version. If Bing would expand their horizons in searches, I would definitely 5 star this item. She does fairly well with recipes and shopping lists. I am going to be trying out the calendar sync portion of this with my wife after the holidays. All in all, very fun, helpful, item. It can order you pizza too. I HAVE PUT THE DOT IN THE BEDROOM WHERE MY ECHO IS IN THE LIVING AREA. MY FAMILY USES HER FOR EVERYTHING. ENJOY EVERYTHING ABOUT THE ECHO / DOT. Perfect size. Works great. Just as advertised. Has a long battery life. I bought these as a starter online browser. It is a very portable pad . Great price. Cheaper than the paper white and has more abilities My son is 3 and he loves it so easy to use. It\\'s great. I use it at home instead of a computer. I gave it four stars instead of five because it seems to lose wifi frequently. However this could be due to house wifi issues. The tablet is fast and easy to use. Love the ease of downloading books. Many features packed into a low price. Good as an ereader or light tablet uses to surf internet, email and games. Easy to use. Memory is expandable too. Promising product that has been getting better with software updates since release. The family really enjoys the Amazon Tap. This is an awesome investment. We talk to Alexa everyday. Bought this with the intention of reading more, it serves it\\'s purpose! I will be purchasing another one soon for my nephew, for his books and learning games. Quite light, easy to conceal, easy to use and quite quick. This was a perfect tablet for my 12 year old. It does everything that she needed it to. My husband loves this. He is happy that he can read anything he chooses from his library and that he also has WiFi access to get to his email and the internet whenever he wants. We love our Alexia! We mostly use it for music and to control the lights. I bought this for my daughter who uses it in her AP classes...easier to use a bigger screen than her phone screen in class. She loves it!Price was great! This is a nice little tablet, for me since I don\\'t do a lot on a tablet, it\\'s a great size. It took a little getting use to working with, but am a little more comfortable with it now. Love this product easy to use and it does so much ch Great product and it is very easy to set up and use I bought this for my 3 year old son for Christmas. It keeps him busy while my wife and I take him out to dinner at a restaurant. It\\'s relatively easy to use and he likes some of the kids videos we downloaded for free. Bought for my 2 year old granddaughter l, she loves it, so easy to use .. She can navigate through it with no problems We got a great deal on Fire HD 8. My kids love playing on it. My second Kindle fire. Lives up to Amazon\\'so description When I purchased this item, I was unaware how much it really does. I can literally control my entire home with it. Even though it is a little pricy, I like my new Kindle Voyage. It looks smaller, but it is because it\\'s only the screen - no buttons. It is lightweight. You can scroll and turn pages with touch screen press or with physical small buttons on the side. It is automatically adjusts to different light conditions. I bought these for my five and six-year-olds and they love the games and educational apps that come with it loaded from Amazon prime for free for a whole year. Great value for the money I will be referring this product to all of my friends. I‚Äôve been enjoying this item and getting information so fast. Best purchase I ever made. kid proof! bought for my grand babies and they love it! Great tablet for many uses. Purchased mainly for reading but have used it multiple times just browsing the web and social media. This replaced a Kindle 7 HDX with 32GB of ram. The older tablet had a charging port that wasn\\'t functioning anymore. Had the Geek Squad warranty so they issued a full credit for the old tablet and my son chose the HD8 as his new tablet. Other than the screen resolution being lower and less memory, great tablet. My son didn\\'t care about the resolution and the new Kindles let you pop in an SD card for more storage. Popped in a 64GB SD card and he\\'s a happy camper now.. ;) It\\'s not open yet it\\'s a bday gift. But I think they will love it This has got to be the best electronic purchase I‚Äôve made in recent months! Easy to set up, so many skills to enable, Alexa knows it all! The range is about 30 feet for it to hear and recognize my voice. Be sure to speak clearly. Great purchase, and exceeds my expectations. Works great with my iOS devices too! I bought this item for my nephew and he loves it. I have the old version of the fire hd and I love it as well. It\\'s way cheaper than buying an apple tablet. We haven\\'t had any problems with it. Well worth your money Great tablet for my childthis tablet was just everything that I need it for my child I DON\\'T USE MUCH OF THE APPLICATIONS BUT IT WORKS FOR THINGS I NEED. The amazon Show has to be one of the best smart home devices that every came out. Alexa, Videos, music, and drop in. Amazing product!!! I got the amazon Fire HD 10 for reading and other activities. It was very easy to set up. Netflix worked ok on it. It mostly works well, but there are limitations to the apps that are available. I tried it out for a while and then returned it for a Samsung S2 9.7. The only problem I have is have to recharge battery every 4-5 hrs. Other than that is a great item !! easy to use. nice sides and easy to read ,, also very easy to load I use it to stream movies while on the tread mill at the gym This is great if you have two kids and want to give them a tablet to play with. My problem is that my child is dyslexic and this is the lowest level reader that currently supports audible.com... that is the hardware supports audible. In order for my child to use audible I had to disable all of the family features and try to turn it into a reader... I was sad because there are lots of great family features that I had to disable.I did not use geek squad, I reached out directly to kindle support. Pre-sales, they could not tell me the difference between the free and paid family packages. I had to get to a senior person to help me figure be out why audible did not work and the to disable the family features ... even then, I could not disable the Alexa app. My child has full access to Alexa and the rights to turn on shopping.... kind of scary.So my disappointment is that Amazon does not make a kid friendly kindle that we can have audible.com on for my child\\'s learning disability. The screen size is good and the HD pictures are clear. I also like the camera photos. They are better than my cell phone camera. The size of the pictures are great. I would recommend this Fire HD for the ease of use. Love Alexa and everything she can do! So great you can connect to other devices. Good kids tablet for games and videos but the charger is pretty annoying. Great product. Easy to use .very easy to set up .. I purchased this tablet for my grandson who is 4 years old. He loves it! A perfect tablet at a reasonable cost. Why pay higher prices for bells and whistles you don\\'t use. The back lit feature is great for reading in low light conditions. Love the idea of it. Not as easy to put the DVD movies on it . Bought for grand daughter for Xmas since most 5 year olds now a lot about tablets and had no problem with this very easy to use. My wife uses the Tap mostly to listen to music. She loves the fact that she can take it into aNY room of the house. No more having to turn up the sound to hear I\\'m different parts of the house. I need a tablet to begin exploring google and kindle fire was a great choice. Having a great experience using the Alexa Echo plus product. Lighter weight than my old kindle fire. Easier to carry with me. I love my tablet!! I didn\\'t think at first that I would like this size but it is perfect for me. I would recommend this tablet to all my friends. a bit difficult to set up, but it is amazing. Love the screen! Love this product, and don\\'t know why it took so l The kindle over all is great. There\\'s only one thing I would want better and that is the speaker. My last kindle was louder. I really miss the louder speaker. Got this for my 3 year old due to it having the bumper and I will tell you it\\'s well worth it. I couldn\\'t tell you how many times its been dropped and survives every time. This product is great! It is great for those that enjoy using it for reading but also for entertainment. It is the perfect size for sitting in a coffee shop or on your couch to read a book or watch your favorite tv show. The Alexa works well and turns my lights on and off for me in bed, and plays my playlist for when I sleep. Very nice for the bedroom. Not only does it round out my collection of Alexa devices, I have two echos and one dot, it also works well with the Ring 2 Video Door Bell,I can see who is at my front door without opening it. This tablet runs smooth with all amazon apps, the internet runs at a steady frame rate and it had a decent sized screen. So far I haven\\'t had any trouble with this tablet. Only thing that sucks is this I can\\'t text from it. If anyone who\\'s an app for it let me know! Thank you ! This is the second one I bought. My grandkids love them. Love this kindle excellent price I just carry it everywhere. Fits perfectly in my purse. I bought this because I recently signed up for Amazon Prime and wanted to take advantage of the free books. Nice tablet. I can watch videos, check my security cameras, and grey two for a fantastic price I would buy another one for the priceGood product I absolutely LOVE my Amazon TAP. It in my opinion is the best blue-tooth speaker around and with the added skills when on wifi, the TAP is better than the Echo! Portable - YES! Sound Quality - OFF THE CHARTS! I blue-tooth this to my computer and listen to movies with GREAT Dolby sound quality. The battery life has been tested during a camping trip. 8 hours and it kept the charge! It\\'s also easy to recharge it without the stand. Very Cool. BEST BUY\\'s PRICE made it ALL THE BEST BUY OF THE CHRISTMAS SEASON! I picked up the item same day at a local Best Buy. The Experience was 1 - 2 - DONE. Very convenient, very helpful. I would recommend this to ALL my friends!!! It is very convenient and fun. voice comands are easy to use. It plays the music you want and even reads my kindle while I cook. Good e-reader, with an improved design, light-weight My wife absolutely loves this tablet. It wad an early Christmas present Nice little tablet. Functional and easy to use.Fits the needs that I need to use it for. I bought this for my husband for Christmas since our daughter uses the other tablet all the time. He has barely put it down since he opened it!! He uses it mostly for reading and some internet browsing. Overall I am happy with the product and have had no issues so far. Santa brought this to our daughter, she\\'s 7 and it\\'s perfect for her!! Easy to use and figure out! Purchased to stay in touch with family while traveling. I bought this for my wife as a gift to replace her older fire. Absolutely loves it. Has all of the features she needs. I don\\'t think there is a better tablet on the market and the value is incredible. My 6yr old son loves the tablet!I plan on purchasing another Fire tablet! The item is a great tablet for basic uses such as email, youtube, and facebook. This has kept my kids entertained, but maybe just a little too entertained. Sadly, they don\\'t want to do much else Never thought a tablet at this price could be this good. Totally recommended! Bought the Amazon - Echo Plus + Philips Hue Bulb - Black for my kitchen it is awesome also came with free smart bulb. Bought it for my wife she loves it and I would but one for my self too So great to instantly see family members to chat, demonstrate, check-in... PLUS all the wonderful features of the Echo devices including video clips, movies, etc . Nice addition to the home but not essential; would recommend as a gift and although I like t I could definitely live without it Easy to use. Quick setup. Fantastic screen and the colors are vibrant. Great over all Tablet! Good build quality, but cheap enough for the kids to use / loose. Really a plus for travel. Install VLC media player from the amazon app store, and then you have unlimited movie options for up to12 hours. Add some head phones and that 6 hour trip to Disneyland, well it\\'s so much more tranquil for the adults. Having LOTS of fun with Alexa! Tells us weather, stories, plays music trivia games with us, helps with shopping list, and can face to face talk with my sister in another state (bought one for her too) - great addition to our home! It\\'s small, light, and easy to read from. I just wish I would have spent the extra 30 bucks and got the paperwhite. The more i use this one the more I wish I had the option of a backlight. If you\\'re on the fence as I was, go with the paperwhite! However if the backlight is not an issue, this device is great and I would recommend it. The best Kindle I have ever used. It does everything. I was wishing I good set it up to my pool equipment. I bought this for my sister for Christmas. She loved them! I had reservations for the purchase of this Echo show, they quickly eroded after setting it up and using it now since Christmas day. Everyone in my family loves the camera function, sound quality, picture resolution and basically everything about it!It isn\\'t totally perfected yet but it is a work in progress when it comes to the skills and how you choose to use this device since it is definitely designed for Amazon and their customers. Versatile enough so that everyone could find something to enjoy from music, pictures, videos to having your favorite book read to you. One of my favorite features are the Ole time radio series offered in the skills. Takes you back in time as you relax and very similar to a good book. Just my preference and it does offer much more and new skills are daily being added. Although we have several echo dots everywhere, my 6yo loves to come to the echo show to hear her music or to see new pictures uploaded to our cloud. The sound is amazing for its size, that\\'s a huge plus. Pictures are dynamic and so far the only issue with me anyway is it\\'s shape. Slightly odd but it seems to blend into our decor pretty well. Hopefully newer and even better skills will be made as this is a real gem in the rough with tons of applications still ahead that it can be used for. I have it connected to our home security system, robot vacuum cleaner and at times to my cell phone. Taken all together it is useful, fun and a nice addition for our gadget loaded home. Bought two of these for my grandson and grand daughter and they love them. I like the parental controls and the apps. My grandkids play on my smaller one. Thought I better get a back up for me. Great for those who love to read this tablet is always ready for on the go trips i always buy from best buy. they have excellent products.The workers are very knowledgeable of what they sell.Thanks like better than the 7 inch Kindle better to read. This is the second one I‚Äôve bought this year for gifts My fianc√©e really enjoyes it! I would definitely recommend. New kindle is so much better than paperwhite. Kitty hair always used to get stuck around the borders of the paperwhite - not a problem with the voyage. Coming from a nook reader. Love the even backlighting and weight. For some time I have been searching for a replacement for my Sony DASH which had support discontinued recently. While I am sure that being a bedside \"smart\" alarm clock was not the primary goal of the Echo Show it does fit the bill nicely. This was my first Echo purchase and now I have multiple Echo\\'s and HUE lights. Great system all around! Bought this for my son, it\\'s been through some stuff and still going strong I love all of my Amazon echo devices. Right now it doesn\\'t allow YouTube, but hopefully they will reach an agreement and fix that. Product worked as described. No issues with performance, and it was a simple setup! Perfect for web browsing and videos. The HD8 is a Great tablet. I purchased two for my daughter\\'s. The tablet feels durable to touch. The screen picture is crisp and clear. Great fun r the little ones, had to go buy another because it works so well! Dropped many times and still is doing well! I needed a device to listen to books on a long drive. This paired easily in the car and downloading the audible books was a snap. This was purchased as a gift and they\\'ve absolutely loved it. Great for my kids and is easy to block purchases. Even better if you have amazon prime. Even when I‚Äôm outside in bright sunlight, the words of the book I‚Äôm reading are still crystal clear. That alone makes the Kindle Oasis worth what it cost me.The Kindle Oasis wakes up in just seconds, and any book I choose instantly opens, ready to be read.It is the perfect size and isn‚Äôt heavy or bulky. I really do read for hours at a time. Sometimes I pace the floor while I read. Sometimes I‚Äôm on my elliptical machine when I read. And sometimes I‚Äôm sitting down. No matter what I‚Äôm doing, the Kindle Oasis remains comfortable to hold, and it is always easy on my eyes.When I receive a book that is in PDF, most of the time I can enlarge the words. If it won‚Äôt allow me to enlarge the words, I can change the orientation of the page and the words are automatically larger. I am able to make notes on the book if needed, and I can highlight words and/or passages.My merlot leather cover is attractive. When I flip it open, it is just like opening the cover of a book.How to Make the Battery LastOn the Kindle Oasis page, it says that its ‚Äúdual-battery charging system delivers months of battery life.‚Äù This was a huge thing for me. Instead of having to charge my tablet almost every day, I would be able to read for months without charging the Kindle!Is this how my Oasis has performed? Well, not so much. There are conditions that have to be met for the charge on your Oasis to last for two months.First, you have to limit your reading to thirty minutes a day. That one is impossible for me. There are days that I am only able to read for thirty minutes, but they don‚Äôt occur very often. My Kindle goes everywhere with me, and I use just about every spare moment to read.Second, the wireless needs to be turned off. That one is easy to do but not always easy to remember. The only time the wireless needs to be on is to download one or more books.Third, this is based on your light setting at 10. That is way too low for me. I keep my light setting anywhere from 16 to 18.I don‚Äôt limit my reading to thirty minutes a day, and I try to remember to keep my wireless turned off. My light setting is kept anywhere from 16 to 18, and I put my Kindle to sleep the second I‚Äôm done reading. So how long does a single charge last me? Ten days is the longest a charge has lasted me so far, but it would have kept a charge for several more days if I had remembered to turn my wireless off. Once I succeed in keeping my wireless off, I will let you know how long the charge lasts.Now, I don‚Äôt plug it in to charge as soon as the charge on the cover gets low. I allow my cover charge to go as low as it will possibly go and then the Kindle battery will start to drain since it can no longer charge from the cover. I allow it to drain down to about 50% before I plug the cover and Kindle into my computer to charge.The one thing that surprised me was that everything on the Oasis is in black and white. For some reason, I thought that maybe the book covers would appear in color. But since I bought the Oasis to read books on, color isn‚Äôt needed.Special offers do appear on my screen but only when my Kindle is going to sleep or waking up. They aren‚Äôt a distraction, and to be honest, they are kind of fun to look at. You can pay a higher price so they won‚Äôt appear on your Kindle if you would rather not see them.I asked myself some questions once I had my Kindle and knew just how it worked. If I had known before I bought my Kindle Oasis that the charge wouldn‚Äôt last for months, would I still have bought it? Yes, I would have. If I had known that everything would appear in black and white, would I still have bought it? Yes, I would have. The clarity of the screen and the back-lit text makes this an improvement from my old tablet. I now can read this in low light and enjoy the color as well. I am enjoying my new Kindle, but it did present some challenges in its set up. I would recommend getting help in the store to get you started. Very lightweight and portable with excellent battery life. good price for the product. I purchased for my middle school son. I love that you can read books as well as play games with this tablet. I bought 2 of them for my little boy and girl. We just charge them up and let them play with them in the car on road trips. They are quite!!! The only thing is, I wish they would have a section of games that can be played without wifi. Some of the apps need wifi to run and some do not. Overall though, I love this tablet! I m so happy to get this amazon echo plus. Great to have it. I bought this tablet for my son. He damaged the previous one but it was good for his purpose. He loves to play the Minecraft app and can read a book with ease. I don\\'t have a tablet for myself. If I did, I would get the Fire. All I would really need it for would be to surf the Web and use the apps. For the price, u can\\'t go wrong. May grandson loves this. Went on a long car trip and he was able to watch movies and keep entertained. Easy to log in and set up. Good sound. Needs a remote for the volume as is changes with each radio station, song, or replies. I have not set up tablet, geeks squad to do so Monday April 3 2017 Looks pretty solid will update review as soon as gift is opened . I needed a device to listen to books on a long drive. This paired easily in the car and downloading the audible books was a snap. Does what we need it to. Able to download apps that make it fun. I\\'m a Windows person & this is not Windows. I\\'m still learning. I am happy with the size as it fits easily in to my purse, but I HATE touch items - I always seem to touch the wrong area (like spelling something, I go for a letter & get one of the letters next to - so it slows down my typing - one of the reasons I don\\'t have a smartphone). All in all it\\'s pretty good. I guess I would recommend it because it\\'s the way this world is turning. However, they don\\'t make a glass protective screen cover - only plastic. It\\'s a good starter tablet, to bad it runs on the Amazon OS. I really enjoy reading on the new Kindle Voyage. Have had other Kindle models before this one. I especially like the brightness and lightness of it.Only drawback I needed to get use to was turning of pages being a little hesitant. Bought as a gift for my wife, she loves it and the screen is very handy for recipes and such. My old kindle had no camera and was much thicker. This one has a great camera and is much slimmer. This is a great tablet for the price. Would give it 5 stars if it had included some sort of instruction manual. Otherwise, definitely recommend. I definitely recommend this tablet is so perfect for children. Amazon has consistently delivered quality tablets at the best prices and this is no exception. Love this Kindle. There are to many apps and games offered for download. Love the book selection Easy to navigate The charger seems a bit loose, though It has all the features needed for my granddaughter and is easy to use. I\\'m am happy with this. Bought for my children. Holds plenty of apps. Safe to use with parental controls. Pretty durable but definitely recommend buying a screensaver and case for it. What can I say, if you enjoy books and magazines it\\'s hard to beat. Not backlit but not an issue for me. I take it everywhere and enjoy this version very much. Love this!!!!It is kidproof...I have a active 1 year old grandson who enjoy it very much!!! I\\'m enjoying the ease of having several reading options without the bulk. Fairly easy to use on set up and use. Most annoying issue is when the kids try to talk to her. Mainly use for music and general information. Bought as a gift but have not had any issues with products purchased from you I am very happy with the kindle fire hd 8. it is very easy to use. This may be an incremental upgrade to the original Amazon Echo but is definitely worth it. Miles ahead from Google Home. The kinde was really good and my dauther like it. It is very good product and i would reccomend this to al my firends and family. The device is priced just right to give as a gift for an 8 year old Great tablet for kids very entertaining and informative for kids learning I went into the store looking for a Bluetooth speaker for music and left with this. Works great and sounds good. As far as functionality it works well. I can surf the internet, match movies, check social media, and anything else a tablet is supposed to do. The app store has a good variety off apps. It does not have as many as the iTunes store, but there is plenty of variety. The reason I knock a star off is the constant ads. I know that this is an Amazon product, but the ads get a little annoying. My almost 4 year old will recieve this for christmas this year but i set it all up prior. I love the parental locks and timers!!!! Soooooo many fun characters for her to choose from to enjoy at every level. The case is soft and light but sterdy! I‚Äôm an amazon prime member and the show is awsum I use it to communicate with the son who lives in Seattle. You can watch amazon pirime tv,play amazon music. Text, play games read the lyrics while the song is playing. I love it I need to buy all the additional parts but it‚Äôs great This is a great tablet if you have reasonable expectations. And you should definitely pay the extra $20 (for a total of $69) and get the 16 GB tablet. Is it the fastest tablet out there? Definitely not. Does it quickly do all sorts of business spreadsheets applications, etc? No. Does it do everything that an i-pad etc can do? No. But at this price point it can\\'t be beat. People say that you can\\'t download chrome and the google playstore. They are WRONG. I have both on this tablet and my other fire, without rooting them. And with the ability to add a 128 GB card it\\'s a no brainer if you want to play games, watch movies/tv, surf the net, email etc. I know there are a lot of people who dislike Amazon and their products, but I am obviously not one of them. Echo plus seems to work as they say. I have it running two lights so far. Plan on setting up seven more. Nice product. Easy to play and very helpful to learning for children\\'s I loooooove this tablet as well as my 3 year old with all the kids apps make it way more fun and safe for kids to enjoy Brought for my daughter and she loves it. Wish it had more Google stuff on it I love how Alexa can control almost all smart things and help control lights and power on and off devices to help us get ready for the day. The music is connected directly to Amazon Prime Music and I love how the sound is clear and crisp. You can call out to Alexa from far away and she‚Äôll add items to your shopping list and the Alexa app is so simple to view the lists and control your smart things. New version is much better, Integrated Hub works great and response time is better than previous. Upgraded to this one from older version. Responsive. My newphew loves it! He\\'s 4 years old and can easily use the tablet. Amazing how much stuff this can do everything from a alarm clock to listening to music,asking questions and controlling devices .the sound front the speakers is really great. Needed to replace the old Nook. Looked at the fire and was a little unsure. At this price though you get more than what you pay for. I travel alot for work and this has earned it\\'s place in my travel bag. Well most of the time it\\'s actually in my back pocket so I have quick access to it to get some reading done. For anything to be carried on my person during travel is high praise from me because that means it has value and importance. The sales associate was knowledgeable enough to lead me in the right direction in purchasing this product that‚Äôs compatible with my mother‚Äôs Arlo Security cameras. It works great! I added to a \"dot\" purchase for my daughter, and she loved it! The portability and charge feature she really likes. Great gift! This is a great product but we exchanged the unit for the 2nd generation because of space limitations. It works great too. The echo show does so much,the music line up is good,it can do anything. Works great. Easy conversion for an aging guy without much technological experience. Love my kindle fire, takes awesome pictures and its convenient for on the go. I bought it for my 2 year old and he loves it. It\\'s easy to use and the perfect size for his hands. bought this for my niece and it works perfect, she easily navigates all menus and features... This works perfectly for the smart home connecting to all your devices. Coupled with Amazon prime this has it all. Voice speaker clearly understands you from up close and from across the house. It fits easily into smallest purse so it\\'s always at hand when waiting in lines while traveling. Lightweight, especially without the case. Shape of back provides easy grip. Accelerometer allows it to be held in either hand. Would like to be able to charge the reader and the case separate, but that\\'s a minor thing. The echo is great for choosing music and getting information. The voice is very soothing. Love my kindle, makes reading at night so easy and it feels like you are reading a real book. Bought this for my grandson and am very pleased with the quality. The case protects it well. I really like that my child is engaged with all of the different apps we have downloaded. I‚Äôm a big Apple consumer all around but after tons of research and testing, I went to alexa over Siri (Apple home kit) to make my full home a smart house. My sister in-law recommended these to my wife and I and I thought I would try one. They are just the right size to lay in bed of a evening and read a good book for a while. IFeel confident purchasing products from Best Buy due to protection coverage My daughter bought a show so my 10 year old grandson could get in touch with her when he got home from school so I bought one so he could call us and we can see each other. We love it. Tablet is a great tool to use the world wide web and check email. Love being able to set a timer, play music and turn in my Wi-Fi connected lamp without moving from my couch. Great for little kids who have a problem with breaking stuff. I have really enjoyed these products so much I actually bought 3 of them. Fun to watch and even better if you are an Amazon Prime customer for music and video. Enjoying Alexa! There is so much you can ask her! Looking forward to the security monitoring . I got this for my kid, because it is tailored for kids. They liked it and it worked. Any Kindle product I have purchased is easy to use Bought for our 6 year old. Great parental controls allow you to keep track and monitor use. Would recommend for others to get for their children My nephew loves his kindle. Durable structure that can withstand drops. My teenager loves to read and we purchased it for her. Great purchase! Great amazon device i love these have 2 in my house they are awesome This Amazon Fire is perfect for what I need - nice screen and memory size, really nice apps preinstalled and it\\'s just ready to use! The Black Friday price was beyond wonderful!!!!! These items are easy to set up. They have added value to our home. The show has a good picture and good sound...love using it to look things up Great price of 89 dollars on a great tablet. It is very fast at everything accept game play. For example it plays asphalt 8 and the game is just barely playable. The graphics struggle on this tablet with higher graphic games. Also it is a Amazon tablet with no Google play store but you can load Google play on to it. There are great you tube videos on how to put Google play on a amazon tablet. The screen is good as long as the sun isn\\'t hitting it. The stereo speakers sound great and loud. All in all I really liked the tablet for the price but I really like to play games with good graphic quality. So that being said I did return this tablet and ordered the Nvidia Shield 8 inch tablet through Best Buy for 199 dollars. I got the Shield a week ago and WOW!! What a difference in graphic gaming quality. This thing is just as good as an Xbox1 or ps4. The Nvidia Shield tablet is simply unbelievable for the price of 199 considering the Apple or Samsung tablets that are as fast as this tablet are at least twice the cost. Plus this dubbles as a gaming console for xbox or pc games with 4k out to you tv. The Amazon tablet is also a great tablet for normal usage but if your a gamer like me the Nvidia tablet is the tablet of choice hands down period!! I don\\'t know why bbuy kind of hides the Nvidia tab only on their website and doesn\\'t sell it in the store. If they displayed it in the store. This would outsell the Apple or Samsung tablets. I hope this helps thanks. Great little tablet, easy to use for kids. Wish the battery was bigger. Overall not a bad purchase. Got this tablet to replace the one that had the screen cracked, cheaper than getting the screen replaced can not do without my kindle fire.I had an earlier model 4 years ago.it is still going , just wanted a backup. i just adore my fire 8...the features, size of screen, easy log in and graphics Like this a lot, just wish they would come with more instructions on all the things that can be done on it. Purchased for our niece. She is 6 years old and it\\'s perfect for her. She loves it! The Echo and the plus are great for people not wanting to run wires. And the waterpik was all we wanted Easy and age appropriate. Can set timers for tv and movie watching my granddaughter finds the educational games more interesting and fun. Bought for 4yr old, so older kids would stop saying don\\'t touch that. Comes with durable child case. Large enough to see and hold, but small enough to carry. Easy to use and can download favorite stuff. tablet is so user friendly and a price you can not beat This is my 2nd Fire tablet. I will alwyas need one. Just wish they lasted longer than 4 years. We bought one for my wife and my mother-in-law and they both love it. Very easy to use. My 2 year old son really enjoys the tablet it\\'s great I like that you can Talk To Alexa. I like the lyrics to the music. I like the personal Assistant, It is So wonderful and limitless. I love this tablet! love my ipad , too, but this is much lighter weight and easier to slip in my purse. I went for a 32g but there were none in stock, so I got the 16 and a memory card that I will probably never need! It\\'s very good product and I recommended this to buy it. Already have a few other Alexas. Wanted on to be portable around the house without having to plug in or connect to another speaker. Works as expected. Affordable and kid friendly. My kids watch videos and play games on these a lot. Lots of apps, games and books to choose from! The speaker is an improvement over the Echo Dot, set up was easy and connecting additional home automation products to it as we acquire them has been a simple process. Works as advertised! Have not really had a need for the HUB part yet though. I‚Äôve always loved the amazon Alexa smart products and use them to control my smart home setup. Very easy to set up! Easy to connect with multiple Amazon Echo Dots, as well as multiple smart home products. I bought this for a daughter, who would be taking this to school for BYOD. It\\'s perfect size table offers, loads of amazon goodies if you are prime member. For our need, it was good enough, but one of the requirement was to have Google App support on this. Since this runs Fire OS, it\\'s everything Amazon proprietary. There as \"howto\" on web on getting google play store and its app on this, but the integration with the device lacks upon those \"fixes\" from the articles on how to get Google app store working on this tablet. Since it would not be useful for her in school because of requirements for Google apps, we\\'re returning it. Otherwise, Great tablet, but Fire OS restricts Google Apps. Durable and great tablet to handle and navigate. Camera quality is good to be used by a 2 year old. Great children features This doesn\\'t require separate speakers and has great sound We bought two of these for the kids. They love them and I now have an echo dot The first one was not working so we had to take it back and get a new one Needs some improvements on being able to answer questions, but all in all its great and the sound is stellar So far this tablet has been efficient. It kinda bad is difficult to use and it seems to require a lot of steps to get the kids profiles set up and it actually does not do everything I hoped it would. I use Alexa every day. I do not know how I lived with out her before I have had every kindle since the first and this is by far the best. The screen was already great on the Voyage but the front light on this screen is more white and more evenly distributed. Physical page turn buttons are so much better than none or the haptic feedback type. They didn\\'t include the automatically adaptive front light for some reason but I don\\'t think I\\'ll miss it much as I was always wont to fiddle with it on the Voyage anyway.But this device made me smile as soon as I held it for the first time because it has a larger bezel that you can really grip comfortably without touching the screen. Maybe this isn\\'t a big deal for most, but that is exactly why I spent the money to get this device.The other thing I was hoping for was the ability to use the upper page turn button to go forward and this device does that and even better because it is software configurable.The cover is very small and light and doesn\\'t add much bulk like the Voyage Origami case does. The only downside is that it doesn\\'t work as a hands free stand for reading.(I still wish it was waterproof) Great customer service at Best Buy I was able to navigate through the product before actually purchasing it I will def be back and highly recommend it Can\\'t believe I waited so long to get a real e-reader. So easy to read from. I like the bigger screen size. It allows me to read my books without straining my eyes and allows more of the text to be displayed. The kinde was really good and my dauther like it. It is very good product and i would reccomend this to al my firends and family. Using for Pandora in an office setting. Set up with older system and speaker system - works great. I was debating whether to get the stationary Alexa device or the Tap and decided on portability. It\\'s been fun figuring out how to phrase requests but with a little trial and error we\\'re on a roll. I use it for play lists at work, alarm clock announcement by Dan Marino and news briefs. It\\'s surprisingly sturdy but wish it was waterproof so I could take it with me while fishing. This serves every function I need in a tablet. Price is right. This was the perfect gift for my grand kids they love it. My granddaughter loves this tablet. Perfect for a 5 year old Nice it all ready has Amazon and apps built in. Great buy. This an awesome tablet for kids. My Grandson never wants to put it down. The case is great protection from drops. Easy to set up and use. Useful and fun. The videos make things easy to understand. nice size screenlike feachers included storage very goodexcellent color clarity Great product. Great price. I\\'m reading more since I started using a Kindle. this is a steal, have 8 gb model as well.This has more punch.. The echo show works great for home automation. Being able to see your security cameras or drop in on your home through the echos camera are great features. The echo is great for music, weather, and anything else you have integrated in the house. Would definitely recommend to family and friends that have little kids great learning tablet My new Echo Plus has been a fun find. It is working as advertised, and we are still exploring the many, many ways you can use this device. You do need some tech savvy on apps, wifi, and willingness to do some reading on the various \"skills\" but it is well worth it. Already added an Echo Dot to the mix. this was purchased for my granddaughter for her birthday Up and coming new technology helps everyone to enjoy life more greatly this tablet is great for reading the text is not a good as it is on my tab s2 9.7 in but this is about $200 cheaper i got it because i wanted a more natural book feel reading my books and the tab s2 was not doing it for me great product with many functions I would highly recommend it to a friend. Great learning apps. My 3 year old won\\'t put it down. This tablet is great for kids. I bought it for my Grandson and he is delighted with it. He uses it constantly. I have had the competitive products and nothing compares. I am very happy with this tablet. My kids spends hours of hours on this neat device. It\\'s 85% as good as an Echo... Great sound, nice and loud, but... But the button. That button!!I would give this 5 stars and buy more of them, IF it was always listening while plugged in. Other than that, it does everything an Echo does, it\\'s smaller, and (due to the battery) portable. I like it - I do. But it\\'s not as useful as the Echo in the situation I use it the most. Great Christmas gift for my son. Best tablet ever. I already own an echo dot but don\\'t love the sound quality for music playback - the tab does a great job especially when you consider its size and price - overall very happy It was okay, but most of my apps were stripped down versions on the HD-Fire. It was inexpeisve, but you get what you pay for. The O/S is pretyy premitive. The hardware does fell nice. I would say it is the perfect device for an older or younger person. Great product. Didnt realize it‚Äôs compatible with different items this Amazon fire tab works really well.the syncing aspect is very nice being able to pair it with all my devices.i wish it had Google play. Download can be slow at times.Overall good product. My wife purchased this for me at Christmas. Was very surprised because she said she did not want a device like this in the house. I think she is enjoying it more than me. Easy to link with nest thermostat and smart plugs. Even figured out how to operate older garage door with it. If I can only figure a way for it to bring me a beer now. Upgraded to the Plus with a lot of the accessories. Bought 2 as Cristmas presents for my nephews. Both, ages 10-13 had them up and running within 20 minutes. Had fun asking questions and adjusting the Philips light bulb to different brightness levels. All in all it was a hit. Easy setup for connections to wi-fi cameras, Amazon Digital Subscriptions and coming soon....YouTube. Add your videos and BOOM...to the screen they come. Not very user friendly, in addition the camera exposure is not sharp enough. However a great tablet for a child to play with. Along with fire TV, a prime membership, an amazon music subscription, other home automation devices and the Alexa app on the phone this system is very functional. this tablet is a good for small children it has a good cover I think this is one of Amazon best products ever. I first review the echo online and watch youtube video. It is better than I read or saw on line. I bought this tablet for my kids to watch videos and use mostly educational games on it and they love it. I have the spot, dot and two shows, I started out with the spot and loved it so much I wanted a bigger one. This was a (Best Buy) ! No pun intended lol I was surprised on how easy it was to use. I bought it for my mother and she totally loves it, and I do too! Bought for my 7 yr old. Quality product at an affordable price. Bought on sale for $69.99. Upgraded; easy to use; thinner; very happy with it. I decided to buy a kindle fire because of the price. It\\'s way cheaper than most models and more reliable. I honestly didn\\'t think I would be able to do much.with it, but can do a lot. I have Netflix on it and have binge watched a lot because of it. I am quite happy with my purchase. Bought this for a work fundraiser and the recipient enjoyed it I ordered this and actually came in earlier than predicted and it works beautiful! I\\'m totally happy with my purchase!!! Easy to use. Perfect for using for my clinicals in nursing school Was looking for a tablet that was highly portable & could run my DIRECTTV app & stream videos. (Other electronics I have are much older versions). Salesman recommended this model to me based on personal experience. I am still learning all its functions but so far it seems easy to use & is doing what it promised to do. Haven\\'t had any issues until recently my son\\'s tablet won\\'t charge anymore. Called geek support but they couldn\\'t locate warranty so I\\'ll have to go in I bought this tablet for my 13 yr. old God-child and she loves it. This was her Christmas present. great sound , easy to use, wife love it, connect with wifi and all my phones. Perfect Tablet for my grandkids. Easy for them to use as the parent can set up controls on this tablet. ABC Mouse can be downloaded for preschool kids which is a plus. Purchased 4 one for each of my grandchildren so there is no more fighting of tablets. Great find! Thank you Best Buy. Also I purchased the insurance for these tablets because you know how little ones are. Overall everyone was very happy at Christmas Best electronic I purchased for myself this year. Great price too. Have a nook , this is much better has more apps and thru amazon One of the best inexpensive tablets on the market. Great for the casual user The touch is a great device to control connected home products. Perfect for outside use for prime music also. Inexpensive, but well built. Easy navigation. Streams movies well. Sound is decent, but requires headphones generally. Screen is good size and clear. Finding a case for this model is a challenge - I found on-line, but expensive considering tablet price. Universal cases don\\'t work due to button placement. This camera is a great addition to my home I really like it I got this for my daughter\\'s for Christmas this is a great gift it helps them learn and keep them out of trouble thanks again Best Buy. I am loving this tablet. My previous tablet was a 1st year Fire. This tablet is great for reading, games,facebook and emails. I lost my tablet in Germany and wanted a replacement fast. Best Buy, had both the 7 and 8 inch Kindle fires in stock, after reading the reviews, I decided to go with the 8 inch. Boy was I glad that I did, the larger viewing area, is great for watching movies and Netflix on the airplane. The 8 inch has stereo sound , unlike the 7 inch which has only mono. Overall I am really happy with this tablet I control all my smart home sthings with it, and also have 2 echo dots I am very happy with this Amazon tablet. I purchased it for business purposes, as well as recreational, and it works great for both. I did get an SD card for more memory. Also, if I would have bought directly from Amazon, there would\\'ve been a 1 month wait. However, I was able to order from Best Buy online, and pick it up that very day!!! The visuals entice utilizing the product with greater frequency. Easy to set up and works well. There should be a manual to accompany the product. Going online encourages the purchase of a book of directions, rather than a simple online manual. But, I can\\'t figure out how to move books I\\'ve read, into the Cloud? I don\\'t like clutter, and the more I read and download, just clogs up. I had a smaller version and this was easy to adjust to and use. I like the video feature for my doorbell. Wish it automatically showed a picture when door bell rung. Does not FaceTime. Maybe later. Also not all cameras are compatible. This is my second Echo purchase. My first was the original Echo for my home and the automation feature aside. The sound is excellent, Alexa\\'s response is better than any digital assistant to date, and the ready access to Prime is convenient. This is all of that and portable and rechargeable as well. Additionally the inclusion of Bluetooth and a headphone jack is amazing. Excellent combination and easy to install and setup. my wife loves alexa it was an early Christmas present makes things easy to control. connects to other products Seamlessly control your house, tell Alexa to turn on your favorite music, and play games. Not much else you could ask for, especially for the price! grandson really enjoyed it Christmas. very easy to use I love my Kindle for reading manga and comics. The fact that the graphics are worse than my phone detracts a little from the expirence, but serves to remind me that I cheaped out and bought yesterday\\'s model. This is not a real negative, it just appeares less crisp than my phone. The increased picture size more than makes up for it in my book. I am still learning all the different things I can do with the Kindle Fire. So far I like it. This product is great! It is great for those that enjoy using it for reading but also for entertainment. It is the perfect size for sitting in a coffee shop or on your couch to read a book or watch your favorite tv show. I bought the echo after seeing it demonstrated by my brother. He proceeded to ask Alexa questions and Alexa would answer them immediately. He then asked it to pull up some songs which, it did right away. Then he asked it to call mom and it did that as well. Needless to say, i had to get one. Love being able to turn a light on when I walk inside with no hands! Alexa is a lifesaver Echo Show is everything I thought it would be and more. The alarm and music actions are the greatest. Good size for space I had for the TV. The color is good. my kids love the kids fire they use it every single day. its durable.. I can put parental control on certain things.. great buy Searched around for the perfect tablet for my 3 year old. After testing tablets in stores and reading reviews online the kids fire stood out. The 2 year warranty and free year access to kids content is amazing. The soft foam case provides coverage for drops, the battery life is good for a few hours of play time and the charge time is quick after. For the money this tablet cannot be beat , only minor issue ive noticed is having connection issue with networks at times but this is can be fixed by disconcerting and reconnecting to network. Overall this is a Best Buy for the money, tablet can also be used for adults when you exit the free time app. This really is a great product, it has performed as expected so far Goog tablet the only bad part is that you have to be creating a profile and thats where it gets complicated because when they sell u the tablet they saw its for kids Definitely worth the investment...I may get a couple of more! Samsung Experience Professionals Jon, Neil and Tony were an ideal match for someone looking to upgrade to a new phone. The sales deal was unbelievable - $200 Best Buy card upon upgrade to a Galaxy 7 phone. The sales points that won my business were battery life and charging power. New phone can connect wireless charge without adapter. I am a very happy customer. Bought it as an e-reader. Convenient and easy to use. Text is very readable. I am pleased. read the reviews, bought this tablet to replace an e-reader. Way more than I expected. Video was better than reviews stated, books load faster than my old one Still getting used to a new OS but I am very pleased Good tablet for basic needs. Screens resolution is pretty good. Mostly using for reading and sometimes for watching movies/shows. Great feature is the possibility to use the card to expand the memory. Good product for great price! This amazon echo show is great for room monitoring. It was priced well and I find it useful. Actually easier to hold than a paperback, and might even be lighter! It‚Äôs the greats Idea for your home lighting in your home or business We really enjoy the Echo Show! I have the Echo in the living room & the Echo Show in the bedroom. It‚Äôs great to have the visual of all the requests for Alexa Got this for my wife for Christmas. Was suppose to come wrapped but didn‚Äôt. Wife very happy. Avid amazon fan. Sound better then the echo. I bought this tablet to replace one I had bought a while ago for my daughter, all I heard upon opening is \"Mom, you are the best\", as she was excited to get a newer up to date Fire. She loves the fire tablet and so do we as a family. Amazon Fire is our go to. We can not switch to anything else! I have two kids and they both love it. Its also nice because it is already setup for them. Great item for controling your lights in my home even when I\\'m away. We\\'ve had this tablet for about a month and have no complaints. Great tablet for a kid with lots of storage for games! Item work well and was easy to read from in day light This tablet is perfect for my six year old\\'s learning apps. This is great! Like having a robot brain in your house. Purchased for our 3 year old grandson. He loves it. I got theses tablets for my grandkids for Christmas, they love them. Bought this for my great granddaughter for a gift. She loves it and it is easy for her to use I wasn\\'t sure what to expect from my echo show, but I am super happy that I bought it. Alexa is great. She tells me the weather, traffic, news updates and more each day. I enjoy my new smart speaker. It is a good device that I can get my pandora radio on it, especially in the app. Learning what the device offers for smart home, besides that. It is good speaker to work with different apps. Very durable for a child. Offers more than one user so everyone can read their favorite books. Long time Alexa user. The video screen just takes it to the next level great product Enjoy being able to view my Ring doorbell camera in live time upstairs When I purchased this item, I was unaware how much it really does. I can literally control my entire home with it. A perfect gift for someone who has everything and a busy schedule I do like the portability of my Tap. You do lose some features from the Echo - like speaking to it from across the room. But i\\'m happy with it and it has good sound. great to take out by the pool! Alexa reminds me of all my appointments and it‚Äôs a great tool I bought this a few weeks ago and use it every day. i\\'ve had no problems and it works perfectly! My only complaint is the camera. The pictures are not as clear as I would prefer. All in all though, for the price, I would buy it again! Great for my kid. She takes it on all our road trip. I love my new Kindle. The size is perfect. It fits right in my purse. Easy to navigate and I love the touch screen. I am able to read outside without a glare. Only flaw is that it is not backlit, so in order to read in the dark I need a book light. I don\\'t mind that so much, I just wish kindle would come out with a case for this Kindle with a built in book light like they did for the first generation Kindle. After reading the reviews and also seeing in the description that this has a 2 year unconditional warranty we were sold. Our child loves this tablet and he\\'s dropped it many times with no damage. The thick padded case really does work wonders for this. The 8 is bigger and lighter weight than my old 7 and the battery life is longer. It also has more storage and a camera. Love it! Echo show is a great product.Good with my security cameras and playing music.Youtube would be great. This is a great tablet at a great price! We bought a number of them as raffle prizes for our employee appreciation party and everybody loved them! I was worried that my son wasnt going to like the software, but he\\'s having lots of fun with it Very similar to FaceTime on an Apple product.You can watch someone show you how to do something, like a project you are working on. Instead of listening, you can see it! my 2 year old daughter loves this tablet! I witnessed her drop it once (off the couch to laminate floor) nothing I can tell was affected. I was a little reluctant to buy this for such a young child, but with the way we seem to rely on technology these days, plus the cost, I just had to buy it. my favorite feature is the parental controls that allow me to set times ...not just times that it can be used but for certain content as well! I can set the tablet so when my older kids (10 and 8) log in, they need to complete educational tasks for an allotted amount of time before free play... and the whole thing logs out after a certain time so I don\\'t have to go searching for it in their rooms at night :) great tablet, glad I got the bumper too, great price Guys, the Tap does everything Echo does and it\\'s portable! Use it at home for everything, at work on your desk for music, weather, etc, and even poolside as a portable speaker. The tablet is very light and streams well. I only use it to stream movies and it\\'s much ligher then an iPad so makes mobility that much better. Bought this for my Granddaughter\\'s 10th birthday. She LOVES it!!! The protective case it is in is AWESOME and the perfect pink for a girl! This tablet is great for my son. Would be nice if it had a little more horsepower This is my first Amazon Echo and it was a great buy. The Echo Plus works amazing. The voice control of the lights in my house works perfect. No need for a hub. This is my son\\'s 4th kindle. It is reliable but the charging plug area wears out quickly I love this thing! It‚Äôs so fun and easy to use. My 3 year old even uses it to play the trolls or lion king soundtrack Great product for myself! And I bought it when there was great deal on it! The Echo Dot is a great personal assistant, and right now the price is fantastic. It can give you the weather forecast, traffic reports, daily news brief, play music from Pandora or other steaming radio stations, and answer questions, all in a very small package.. . Love my new Kindle fire. This replaces my old one and is just as good. Videos are as good as my tv with cable. Well with every penny spent and better deal than when I tried Amazon. I like this tablet very much except that they have a game or app one has to clear before one gets to the main screen. Other than that the battery lasts a long time and its compact and easy to use. I bought this Tablet for my Wife. She uses it every day. It is very usefulto her. She uses it in place of a computer. She watches movies on it.The Graphics are excellent. Wanted one for awhile so finally got one. Works great. Way better than Siri on my iPhone. Speaker works great for music. Very happy overal I Searched online and talked with people for two weeks before purchasing. When I went to purchase the echo show amazon dropped the price. Love this product am glad I purchased it. Having a blast listening to any kind of music and asking questions. for the price this is a great works well the for the price display is hd love it Quite satisfied w/ purchase ... However, paying 50 dollars for a smart bulb has proven to be a superfluous expense ... No instructions on adding the memory card and how to move things to the card vs on internally. Best thing I got my kids. They don\\'t ask to borrow mine anymore. I like the Amazon Platform that it is on as it ties into my Amazon account. Always a big fan of Kindle. This is my third one to purchase. Why so many you may ask? I never get to use them because every one else in the family grabs them. Great for surfing amd reading books. The whole family has so much fun with this, we all just ask questions just to hear her give us answers haha I purchased the kindle fire because I needed a entertainment only device for long flights. This device is the perfect size for travel and easy to use and set up with your Amazon account. It is worth purchasing a Fire tablet if you are an Amazon Prime member. If not, I would not recommend it because the available apps are limited . My only complaint about this device is that if it freezes it is difficult to reset. My daughter loves her kindle and it\\'s larger than the previous one she had. She enjoys it! if you use it for certain things it\\'s great. Can find most everything on it. Only a few things that can\\'t be downloaded or found in the appstore Great product easy to use. My niece loves it won\\'t put it down. I had the original Kindle and just decided to upgrade. It ‚Äãis a very functional and easy to use. I have multiple echos and dots but this one is way better. Who doesn‚Äôt like seeing the lyrics of the music, or using video chat with other echo shows. I have two and thinking of getting another one soon. We upgraded from an older paper white and couldn\\'t be happier. Got this so Grandma could stay in touch with Grandchildren, Works great and easy to use This is a entry level ereader that only allows you to read in the day...you will not be able to read in the dark I bought this as a gift for a relative with Amazon Echo in his house. He loves it. \\'ve owned the Kindle Keyboard, 2nd generation Paperwhite and now the Oasis. I love the Oasis very much. The ergonomic design is wonderful and makes it a breeze to hold. It is so light -- that is the biggest killer feature of the Oasis. The 10 LEDs look fantastic and I love the return of page buttons. I\\'ve never had one where the screen is flush with the bezel so this is great. All in all, this is easily the best Kindle ever made and even though it\\'s a bit spendy, it will be the one future Kindles are measured against. My son love it. He watch his favorite cartoon shows and love to read books We like the battery endurance. The new 8\" screen is great too. Very easy to set up and use. Really like the screen to view the items searched for, and to read information about the searched item. I really enjoy my amazon. It is getting easyer to use and I am finding new apps every day. I love the preloaded apps. There are 1000 to choose from for all ages. The book selection is expansive. My 3 year old plays with it everyday. Its great for trips in the car or just being around the house. Great Buy!!! I enjoy playing with Alexa....ask her anything and she has an answer. Nice smart speaker. I do wish there was a LG TV Alexa skill. Wife really likes it. Works great& likes the front & back camera. This is a great beginner tablet for children. Bumper pad fantastic for protection from falls. Recently upgraded from Alexa 1st generation. Really like the video screen and how much more it can do I gave my husband this tablet for Christmas. He is very pleased with the product. He likes it much better than the last tablet that I purchased him 3 years ago. He highly recommends the product. Bought as a gift for my wife, she loves it and the screen is very handy for recipes and such. Searched around for the perfect tablet for my 3 year old. After testing tablets in stores and reading reviews online the kids fire stood out. The 2 year warranty and free year access to kids content is amazing. The soft foam case provides coverage for drops, the battery life is good for a few hours of play time and the charge time is quick after. For the money this tablet cannot be beat , only minor issue ive noticed is having connection issue with networks at times but this is can be fixed by disconcerting and reconnecting to network. Overall this is a Best Buy for the money, tablet can also be used for adults when you exit the free time app. I really love it I use it everyday and it works great Kindle fire is great! I already have one myself, so am happy to be giving one as a gift! My daughter loves her tablet because she can carry it to all places Very happy with product. It\\'s a miniature lap top. One of the best tablets on the market for its value I really enjoy the Echo plus. Speaker sorry bds good for playing music and I enjoy having Alexa turn on my lights. Such a great product. I like that it is very small and fit in my purse. I like that the battery last for a very long time. I mainly bought this so my daughter and I could skype daily, but the free time by amazon has proven to be very helpful for kids. The big foam cover is awesome if you have a destructive kid. I was looking for a kids tablet for my grandson but this one is so much better because it can grow with him and it has a kids mode on it which is really nice so he can\\'t order or go online without permission. He loves this tablet and it\\'s very well build . Alexa show is easy to navigate. It‚Äôs wonderful having so much information at your finger tips. My daughter (4) she loves it. Easy to navigate, hard to break. With a price tag of 59.99, this is one of the low-end tablets with a lot of features, but is certainly worth its price tag. But it definitely lacks the features and HD display of its high end variant Fire HD. Bought this tablet for a child at Christmas. After days of research, this tablet seemed to be the best buy of the lot. It had a good processor, decent memory, and good reviews. It should be exactly what a 12 year old would need in a tablet at a great price. On Christmas Eve I went in looking for an iPad as a gift. They were sold out and I was directed to the Amazon Fire HD8. The picture quality is amazing (hence the HD). I watched a movie on it and the picture was better than my HD tv. I have to say, I would buy this tablet over an iPad any day...AND it cost less than a fourth of the price! Got these on black Friday for early Christmas gifts. Very good buy on a pretty good tablet. Want to try one and Best Buy put up the best price. Th tap is good for usage on the wifi network. Use it to play music outside around the house. I am 100 happy with my purchase. I caught it on sale at a really good price. I am normally a real book person, but I have a 1 year old who loves ripping up pages. The Kindle prevents that, it\\'s extremely portable (it fits better in my purse than a giant book), and I have it loaded with lots of books. I finish one and start another, without having to go store. It serves all my needs. I picked this one over the Paperwhite because the price was unbeatable and the only difference that I could see was this one wasn\\'t backlit. A simple book light from the Dollar tree solves that issue. This is my second Kindle (the first being the old Keyboard model, which I put down because I fell out of love with the keyboard. Lol) and it most likely won\\'t be my last. I bought this kindle for my 11yr old granddaughter for Christmas. Me and my husband both had kindles several years prior, and she and my 6 year old grandson love watching and playing on them. Both children have all kinds of game systems but use the kindle way more. My 6 yr old grandson still plays with mine and loves watching you tube, videos and playing games on it. He has several game systems, Xbox, sega, ds but still uses my kindle all the time over those systems.my husband used his all the time for everything from internet to watching movies and shows. I\\'m getting ready to buy my grandson a new kindle( mine is a bit older and has cracked screen now but still works good).He would like one to call his own. I\\'m looking at a 16 GB or 32 GB.they are really durable and tough. This tablet is AWESOME for kids. She is 3 years old and has had it since Christmas. It is easy for her to use and play on her own. It has been dropped multiple times and you\\'d never know it!! I love my Alexa Show. It can answer most of my questions and I use it for recipes and listening to music. I use it everyday. The kinde was really good and my dauther like it. It is very good product and i would reccomend this to al my firends and family. This is a great beginner tablet for children. Bumper pad fantastic for protection from falls. I APPRECIATE the ease of purchasing and reading ! I have found every book title I want plus the recommended books have led me to find new Authors! Kids got the kindle fire for Christmas, pretty happy with it. This echo is amazing and it doubles as a picture display. Product was a Christmas gift, to replace and older Kindle Fire I bought the Alexa Show on a whim, and it was a great decision. My wife and daughter absolutely love it, and they ask Alexa questions and to play their favorite music all the time. The display is very nice, and I love the sleek look of it. Amazon has outdone itself. This tablet is on the smaller side but works for me. Would have gotten 5 stars but the screen is to light when put on dark screen for reading. All the adds make it feel cluttered but that might just be me. Over all for price it is a nice ereader. New to eBooks and researched available eReaders and tablets. What I like best about the OASIS is the weight (lightest on the market), battery life (measured in weeks not hours) and the capability to use it in bright sunlight. Recommend it for all. This is a great Tablet at a really great price. The best part is if you happen to break it just buy a new one It is very simple to start up and use. Great for all ages and experience on using tablets. My grandson needed a new tablet. He had a Nabi for the last two years and had reached it\\'s limit regarding storage. I found this tablet and decided I was the perfect choice because of the great price, memory, and it comes with a \"kid proof\" case. Love talking face to face with family and friends back in the Philly area. It is easy to use and to stay in touch. I can show family things that I have recently bought by holding it up to the camera instead of having to go into a long description on a phone line. My brother told me about this product. I bought it for my son and he loves it. this is my second one and must have one of these at all times Easy to use, good battery life, great back lighting. Great tablet other than the photo image quality is fuzzy and not the best. The Echo Show is great but it is not just plug and play. The app directions are not understandable if you are having problems. However, the Amazon hot line was very helpful. But, who wants to have to call for help every week or two to keep things running. Alexa should be able to talk you through how to resolve her issues. All in all I am getting used to the features and like it. So easy to use super clear can\\'t. Beat the price all around great buy Bought it for my 89 year old mom. She has enjoyed reading on it. Easy to use Love the new Voyage bc it is lighter and smaller. Easier to tuck in my purse. The other plus is the auto light feature. The setup was super easy, the rugged case is awesome, and the selection of books, games, and movies v for the kids is fantastic! The two year no questions warranty makes it even better! Was easy to set up. Excellent sound quality for the price Love this! We have it on our kitchen counter and great for music, news updates, amazon delivery updates, recipes, timer, and soo much more! would get another, works great, having fun with all the options This thing is awesome, great speakers on it too. Go out and grab one My wife said I‚Äôm developing a ‚ÄúStar Trek‚Äù home...while I‚Äôm still learning what all I can do with this over the regular Echo, I am looking forward to getting my Ring Doorbell installed! Great product, I can rave enough about them!!! Very user friendly and straight forward instructions great for all ages I like the price and features of the tablet . Its great in this price This is a great entry level tablet. It does not have all of the bells and whistles of more expensive tablets, however, at its price point the specs are quite impressive. This is an easy purchase for a small sized tablet or for a child. It is powerful enough and the screen quality is good enough. Overall, I highly recommend it. Echo plus is great for home use, to ask questions and turn the lights on when you away. Great tech works well highly recommended no issues I like it. Needs more features to really become a good product. Needs browsing capabilities. My 10 year old has enjoyed playing on this. Great selection of apps and games. It is a great tablet believe it or not it is also great for kids use parental controls. Bought this for my daughter. She loves it. Wifi connection is great. She mostly uses YouTube and google. Love the easy way to control parental accounts from my account. Very useful. I did buy a cover to put on it, because it\\'s so thin, I was afraid it would break. My granddaughter loved her tablet and the color. It\\'s amazing how easy it is for her to use, perfect birthday gift I love it it does everything I want can\\'t believe how great it is It has very good voice recognition; even with the grandchildren throwing all kinds of crazy questions at it. Speaker quality is top of the line. Everyone that has tried it out at our house loves it. Great tablet to keep at work during downtime!! Great value! I bought this one for a family member because I loved mine so much! She was very pleased. The Kindle and cover were a gift for my wife. Her previous one went to the big tech heaven in the sky. She loves both products and couldn\\'t be happier with the products. This tablet is the best you can buy for the money. Great apps, great picture. I had been looking for the product for a while. After much research, I bought it and I am not disappointed. It is a great product. I can tell I won\\'t be bored learning all that the echo show can do. If you\\'re thinking about buying it, just go for it. Easy to read. Light in weight. Has many good features. The Apple Watch is great. I am very happy with the purchase. I‚Äôve been hesitant to purchase this item, didn‚Äôt feel there was an actual need. Alexa has changed my mind. I use this daily with timers and turning off appliances, checking weather and adjusting my heat. Alexa can even arm the alarm system. The tablet was a great fit for my 21 month old toddler. She is able to watch episodes of her favorite cartoons and play some of the apps with assistance. I like that she will be able to use the tablet for years to come just by updating to more age appropriate apps. My wife loves the tablet! She\\'s only using it for internet so far and it has worked flawlessly! Upgraded from a galaxy tablet that was 4 years old. So worth it. This is a very good tablet. The only con is you may have to reboot it too often. This was bought to replace my old Kindle with keypad, and experimental internet. Was surprised how much the Kindle had changed, and at the same price as my old one was when I bought it!Have already shown it to a couple of friends who now say they are thinking about getting one. Love it. Would definitely recommend to a friend. Just the right size to hold in one hand and \"turn\" pages with the other. I love this product would really recommend to any one! I love having the screen available to use for certain tasks like streaming doorbell video, security camera footage, Amazon Prime music lyrics and videos, but I am disappointed that Amazon‚Äôs implementation of YouTube on the Echo Show violated Google\\'s terms of service so they got the app pulled from the Show. Also, honestly, and anyone can prove it just through everyday use, but the Echo is just not as useful as Google Assistant with inquiries. It works pretty well with home automation but it just doesn\\'t understand or can\\'t help with about half of the inquiries I throw at it. I would have gone with a Google Home if there was one with a touchscreen. I would recommend it for those heavily invested in Amazon Prime and home automation. I knew this item would be great, but the Echo Show has exceeded my expectations. This is the perfect reader. Price is great, it\\'s easy on your eyes. Battery lasts longer than a tablet. With a little tweaking you can install Playstore without rooting. It\\'s a great tablet, excellent color, fast, and battery lasts a very long time. The Amazon tablet line is possibly one of the best our there. The functionalities of android and windows with the ease of use equal to an Ipad Love love love my kindle fire. Had the original and then bought and iPad then bought this kindle and I am wondering why I even bought the iPad. Will not switch again. I will stick with my kindle. Not bad for the price and what it can do. It\\'s decent just for web browsing. Reallllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllly I bought it for my 2 year old and he loves it. It\\'s easy to use and the perfect size for his hands. Is great, fun, useful. Great speaker. Kids love it. This Fire 10 is so much better than my old Kindle Fire HD that I now wonder why I waited so long to upgrade. The 10\\' display is awesome and the speed is very good. All the Amazon apps from my old Kindle were immediately loaded onto my new one and adding the others through the Kindle app store was quick and easy. Quickly charges kindle so son can use it. Worked great right out of the package Picked this up for my two year old granddaughter. She loves it and its the first thing she picks up to play with. She can play a lot of the age appropriate games and can navigate around really easily. I even use it sometimes! Tablet is easy for children to use and the battery lasts! Works great for my teenage son. He uses it for reading, playing games, and watching movies Would have gotten 5 stars but the screen is to light when put on dark screen for reading. All the adds make it feel cluttered but that might just be me. Over all for price it is a nice ereader. Very happy with product. It\\'s a miniature lap top. This is a great entry tablet, if you do not want to dish out a few hundred dollars you should look into a fire table. Love this thing. Little apprehensive at first. But Alexa will grow on you Bought this for my 90+ year-old, totally no-tech mom. Her first e-book is Gone with the Wind. She likes the size and ease of use. Great product. Exactly what I\\'ve come to expect from my Kindle readers. The device is extremely useful for all those who choose to have a smart/connected home. The built-in hub helps you to connect your devices easier than not having it. I would recommend this device especially if you have a prime membership. For its price. Amongst the others I felt this was a deal You will be amazed how this works for many questions you ask and Alexa has the answer. However do not expect her to know everything. You will be happy with this purchase. Wanted a tablet but did not want to pay for an iPad. The fire is a great tablet with a crystal clear hd videos. The perfect inexpensive alternative to the iPad Great size, easy to use and it has a sleek look that is attractive. Great sound and portablebility. Nice style, lithium battery, requires wifi and there are internet radio stations and news. Amazon has features available as well. I use mine a lot. I bought this for my niece and she loves it. We take it everywhere. Amazon ECHO show is excellent with add-on video features. The screen is smaller than I expected but meet the requirements. It is a nice hub to use with lights and plugs. Sometimes echo does not work. My son enjoys to play with his tablet but definitely you gotta take a little time to set it up for them to be safe while they are playing with. Easy-to-use. Lots of books obviously but also lots of apps. My only problem with this tablet is if you don\\'t have internet you lose the pictures of the games you have installed and you have to guess to open them. I have two of these for my kids. Ages 2 and 3. They are great for them to watch cartoons and they are slowly getting into the puzzles, books and games on them. Easy to setup and link to amazon account. Only gave it 4 stars because the one downfall is that these tablets are bit on the slow side when either downloading content or loading up some videos. Kids are less patient than adults you know. Overall, well worth the money. My 2 1/2 year old loves this. He can\\'t break it with the thick rubber case, and we can control the games he plays, and how long he plays. Great mix of educational and fun items. The only problem is the charging cord is a bit too easy to break. If they pull it off the charger, it makes the port loose and you have to get the right angle for it to charge. I can use my tablet all time and your conecctions is very good Great sound. Portable. The kids love it. Didn\\'t think I would use it but I tend to use it a lot. We know that our grandchridren are going to love themWe love ours I love the show. It was so easy to set up. I use it every day for music and weather info. Can\\'y wait to see how it works for Christmas cookies. I read all reviews about the tap so I decided to try it, I love it. The tap keeps me up to date with weather, news etc. I use it every day. I got it for my grand daughter\\'s third birthday. The memory is small with the original purchase but you can buy more and I was okay with that. I would like to say this is my best tablet I have ever buy till now. I will rate it more then iPad Mini. Its best with battery, wifi, touchscreen, sound etc. I had other tablet for my kids earlier, but after having fire hd8, I will not recommend or like to go for any other brand in future. You can\\'t get such good quality product in such less price. I am really very happy on my right decision to choose fire hd8 for my family and kids. she loves it, got it for her for xmas, we all love to play with it. This is a nice item..I can set reminders get news and weather..all by the tap of a button My older kids helped me put in the child safety features and then it works great for my special needs daughter Good tablet. Gave as gift and person enjoys it. Recommend Great tablet for the price. Add to that expandable memory and it\\'s a great gift for the holidays. I love my tablet!! I didn\\'t think at first that I would like this size but it is perfect for me. I would recommend this tablet to all my friends. This is not my first Echo product - we have 3 Echo dots. This is a step up for us. I have it placed in the kitchen and love it! The sound is outstanding and I love the screen feature. I will be buying additional ones for family as well as myself. I have had a few kindle\\'s in the past so this was nothing new for me but what I loved about this one is that the screen is big so when I am reading a book it\\'s a lot easier than when I had the first kindle screen. I mostly use it just for the reading but being able to navigate the internet on it is great for when I want to look something up about the book real quick or if you want to search reviews on a book before purchasing. I love it! This is a perfect upgrade to my kitchen Amazon Echo. The speaker itself is a substantial upgrade over the Echo and Dot. I have it connected to my Nest security cams and it\\'s great to check on my dogs when they are having play time in my fenced backyard. It can be a bit distracting with it\\'s random invitations to \"try\" certain skills, but the distraction is worth it! This product absolutely represents the future that I imagined when I first watched Back to the Future 2 decades ago! The only con\\'s that I can think of is sometimes Alexa doesn\\'t hear me so well (same for the Echo and Dot) and it currently can\\'t differentiate between users like Google Home can. I have had the Google Home too, and would highly recommend any of the Amazon devices over the Google Home. The tablet is great and I like the warranty that it comes with, but I don\\'t like the charging port. The wire that comes with the device is too short and will not fully snap into the device. Which will not let you charge the device unless you place it very carefully in the right position and then don\\'t touch it. Had to buy an after market cable with an 8mm plug length to get it to charge. We bought 2 of the tablets and they both did the same thing. On one of the tablets we bought one of the magnetic plugs so that a younger children will not have problems with a loose plug. Gave it to my husband for his birthday and he loves it! He is able to change the screen picture from his phone so there are different pictures everyday. Nice to tell Alexa to keep track of what we need at the store. Can‚Äôt wait to use it more! I go this tablet after problems with 2 Samsung tablets. so far like it. all apps I use available. A little slower than previous tablets that is the only reason for the 4 stars Awesome tablet with access to lots of apps. Great games and learning tools! This is your basic Amazon taplet. Nothing too special about it. I like the Echo Show. I can view my cams, watch a movie and read the news. The camera video is slightly delayed. And I do wish it had a jack for earphones. But the sound on mine is good. The kindle has come in very handy lately, I always have a book to read and this is great to just grab on the go. Battery life is great, only drawback is no backlight. Bought for my daughters dorm, good device for streaming, making calls, etc., even for quick weather report Had a prob with original one I purchased and Bedt Buy replaced it hassle free This kindle is amazing and better than prior versions. Would be so much better if it had an internal battery Screen is very clear and battery last a long time. Very good substitute if you can afford a iPad. Bought this Echo for my wife. She loves how just by speaking she can listen to any type of music. It sounds pretty good too. I was unsure if this was worth it before I did. After buying and bringing it home I‚Äôm glad I did. I enjoy being able to video chat threw it! this product features a beautiful screen to enhance your viewing and information, love this product I bought this Tablet for my Wife. She uses it every day. It is very usefulto her. She uses it in place of a computer. She watches movies on it.The Graphics are excellent. Each and Every Version of Amazon Home Products have gotten better and better. This Amazon Home is the Cadillac of Amazon Home Products. The News Feed on the screen at all times along with the options and features that you can do with this is amazing. I love the ability to call my mom and dad and see what they are doing. They are only a couple of miles away but it is fun. I also love playing music on the device since most of songs include the words. You might find out that you have been singing the wrong lyrics for as long as you can remember. Bought it as a Christmas gift for dad. For someone who is new to gadgets, he is enjoying it! My grandson loves it. Will be getting another one. My wife said I‚Äôm developing a ‚ÄúStar Trek‚Äù home...while I‚Äôm still learning what all I can do with this over the regular Echo, I am looking forward to getting my Ring Doorbell installed! Great product, I can rave enough about them!!! Paid $60 for it on sale during holidays, couldn\\'t ask for better product for the price This device performs great! For the price it\\'s really a steal. Affordable and easy to use. amazon fire 7 inch tablet is a great product and works great and no issues Bought this for my son and he absolutely loves it! My daughter loves the Amazon Fire tablet that I purchased for her! Grandson plays outside with it Love that it has the protected case Plays games with the other kids, Looking for a reader with some basic tablet functions. This was just that. Great tablet for reading and game play. Color is great. I use Alexa for a alarm clock, turning on lights when I get home and I love listening to any genre of music!! This was the perfect gift for grandkids. I bought one in pink and one in green so each grandchild would have their own color. Lots of games come with the tablet and additional games and videos can be added. It is goodagood and accurate..it is very convienient. I enjoy the amazon Alexa. It is an lot of fun. It will be more helpful once I have completely set up./ This was a gift for my mother who is 99 years. She used to love puzzles, but with arthritis and failing eyesight she couldn\\'t do them. The puzzle app is good because she can see it and use finger to slide pieces. She can keep up with family on Facebook Does the trick. This is a good tablet for the price. Bought this for my daughter for christmas. I know she will like playing games on it Alexa is fun to play with for the whole family, and it fills the house with music when not telling us a joke. We have all three Echo products in our house. Each with a different usage. Got the Show for my parents and sister as well to communicate as we all live in different places. More for my parents, its ease of use is ideal for them, no computer knowledge needed, speak and they can connect with us. Alexa a great product the light too. They are working fine. Product works well and is fairly simple to operate I was resistant to putting down my real books and begin using a kindle. I\\'m so glad I did. It\\'s so convenient to shop and instantly download a book. Plus no more storing hundreds on books in my house. Awesome tablet for young children. They love to play all the videos that it came equipped with already on it. My wife loves it, replaces a Kindle from like 2003. I really like it my complants is that it gives them to many choices that they try to pick all of the apps. Overall good, not great. I get tired of having to push the button to talk to her and she can\\'t find a lot of the music I liked. Am getting some Dots to see how they will work. For price point it works. This tablet is certainly large which makes it cumbersome when reading in a reclining position. However, its terrific for reading or watching films on a plane, desk or otherwise sitting up. the tablet was on sale for a good price, and they had enough in stock for the CHRISTMAS season> grand children were thrilled. So far so good. This is replacing a broken kindle fire. Great item, easy to use,would recommend to anybody want to use! Great price, great item and high quality, simple to buy on line and pick up Great and easy even for someone that is not tech savvy Perfect for my granddaughter birthday. She loves to read. So many books It‚Äôs good I don‚Äôt know what I am doing. Can u say you tube The tablet works just great and the price can\\'t be beat! I purchased this product because I love to read and buying books got costly. With this product I can read all I want for 10.00 a month I bought this for my mom. The type is adjustable and it has a backlight for easy reading ! This is a great addition to the other Alexa products by Amazon. It works great in the kitchen. Better voice recognition and sound. The onscreen display and information are very helpful. The video capability is watching instructional videos or even playing music videos while working/cooking. It can also scroll personal photos as a picture display.All in all Echo Show is a wonderful addition. Well worth it, especially if you get it on sale. I highly recommend this product for children with special needs Easy set up and very user friendly for my children Purchased for my wife who reads a lot and truly enjoys the amazon fire. Amazon Tap is awesome. Seems to do everything the Echo does for a lesser price. Loving it the ability to call up and watch sesame street with my daughter its awesome This was a Christmas present. The person that received it was very happy with it.. She has other Kindles but this new one is an obvious improvement over the previous ones. I love, love my kindle fire magenta. the color is awesome this is a truly the best kindle fire I ever owned . the colors availablesare awesome . I\\'m very happy with my Kindle Fire. Beyond being able to read books, it does all sorts of things and is able to download a huge variety of apps. It also holds a charge very long. The size is perfect and portable, yet the screen is much larger than a smartphone, which I love. I would definitely recommend this tablet to others! My kids love this product, as do I. Parental restrictions can be set and they know when they have to shut them off. Good battery life too. make sure you buy a micro sd card with at least 64 gb of memory. or you will have to constantly delete old items. I love this product. the screen is bigger, the bumper is stringer and my granddaughter loves it...so that\\'s all that matters. Good product and wasy to set up. Works well with smart lights. Great quality, great price and best of all has good sound. Not the paperwhite, but for the price I paid works great for my kids to carry around multiple books they need to read for school This baby is a bargain. Very good screen, decent overall quality and performance...and now Alexa. I use it with Bluetooth speaker and it has become my office music machine. Hold the home button and ask Alexa to play easy jazz. No muss; no fuss. Improves upon \\'regular\\' Alexa because she has a screen now!. We struggled with a surprise Christmas gift this year. The store sales rep suggested this and it was a hit! Alexa does a lot of fun things but you must enable various apps. She gives funny answers to funny question. However, she is not a complete internet surfer, many things she has no answer. Bought it as a gift, wife loves it. Plenty of memory and available apps. A gift to my 3 year old grandson. Great graphics and sound. Works great with good storage but, lacks online browsing speed. I got the wrong one, plain and simple. It does what it says, and I like the connection to the internet to play music, but I should have gotten the Echo, I get annoyed at having to go to it and push the button. You simply must have a virtual voice activated assistant. I can not recommend this product enough. If you don‚Äôt have one, you will eventually. If you can‚Äôt afford you, you aren‚Äôt a Big Baller. This smart bulb works with Amazon echo Plus. It can be turned on and off and also dimmed. The echo Plus is amazing - can play music, control TV and answer many questions. Love Alexa. We currently have three devices that we use on a daily basis. I use one at work basically for streaming music. Great device. No problems connecting to any of them. This product was easy to set up and to use. Works great and has expandable storage which is nice. Employees were very helpful. I always enjoy shopping at Best Buy. I Love this I don\\'t even have to turn on my tv I just talk to Alex a and she does what I tell her. I find this fire much lighter and very easy to use This is an upgrade for my wife as her old kindle wouldn\\'t charge anymore. She likes the feel and the games plus reading material. It rolled over most of her games easily tried to get her to buy an iPad but she has all she needs on thus device I purchased this Kindle for my wife because her Kindle Fire gives off too much glare to use in sunny conditions. Besides being able to use it while riding in the car during daytime, the biggest advantage she found is that it is significantly lighter than the Fire. Since she reads for hours on end that is a big plus. The main drawback is that the graphics aren\\'t as clear with this reader. All in all, it was money well spent. Blue is beautiful & allows grand-daughter to be able to tell which one is hers. Loves the piano program and challenging herself to play as much of the song as she can. Nice size for traveling with. If you don\\'t want or need something cheaper than an iPad but of quality, this is a great happy medium.The processor makes for a fluid ride with it. It\\'s speedy. The Android Store gives you good app options and the Amazon ecosphere is everywhere here.The software is a touch buggy but it\\'s still a great deal of a tablet.For a child, for something you want to use casually on a dime, it\\'s recommended. I like the portability of it. I take it with me when I babysit my granddaughter. The Amazon - Fire Kids Edition is a great device for kids and parents to entertain kids during long or short trips Best Buy associate explained product very well. Easy to use My wife loves the tablet! She\\'s only using it for internet so far and it has worked flawlessly! A step up from last year\\'s Echo. Great addition to any part of the room. So far I have used Alexa to play music. My only comment would be that I wish there was a larger variety of opera music. The echo show is great, works awesome together with my wink hub I can controle my whole house, another cool feature is I can sync my google calender to it and it shows my. upcoming events on the screen. Highly recommend the echo. I bought these for my five and six-year-olds and they love the games and educational apps that come with it loaded from Amazon prime for free for a whole year. Great value for the money I will be referring this product to all of my friends. I like it for controlling my lights. I like that we can play anyone\\'s music playlist. A great addition to our home. Kids love it and is vary helpful excellent gift, ok sound, great portability, would buy again Alexis is the new favorite name. Great for the college student The Echo Show is a great improvement from the original Echo device. It\\'s great being able to \"see\" what is going on!! I enjoy taking photos with me and having enough videos to keep the kids entertained. On the fence go with the larger storage. I do like the Alexa stuff and how it can connect to my phone. Plan on getting the door bell video stuff next. Got this for my Daughter-in-Law and she loves it. Does exactly what she needs it to do. The Fire HD8 strikes an excellent balance between performance and price. It has many of the features you\\'d want in a tablet for a fraction of the cost. Works flawlessly for reading and video streaming. Still seeing if if I like alexa like to try and set up lighting Installation was easy. Directions for use was excellent. Best buy employees were very helpful explaining the product. Best buy always makes the buying process very easy and enjoyable. Looking forward to using the echo plus for many years. This is the 3rd Kindle Fire that I have purchased. This one is much faster and more user friendly. We just bought our 2 grand daughters and 2 grandsons a Kindle Fire with the youngest 8 yrs old. He has it mastered already. Great tablet for a good price. Traded my original echo for echo show. Glad I did, screen is excellent and syncs with many home connected devices. I love my Kindle! It\\'s perfect for reading my favorite books! I bought this for my son\\'s girlfriend as a gift. She really likes it and has positive words. UI is not smooth, it flickers sometimes. Overall a thumbs up from me I got this for my mom to use as her \"computer\" and I am so happy with it. It\\'s ease of use and ability to store pics for my mom is a big plus. Thanks !!!! The Echo is very easy to use and has features that allow users to converse easily with others who may have a hard time learning how to communicate using newer videophone technology. This product removes those barriers. I have had this for several weeks. It works great. I am very satisfied with it so far. I bought this along with the dot and it‚Äôs helpful to use as an intercom Purchased for 4 yr old granddaughter who primarily uses for Netflix. Works great! Great price - great shipping - great item! Perfect Christmas gift for our granddaughter! We purchased the Amazon - Echo Show with Alexa in store. Took it home and after connection wi-fi it was great. we cannot wait to buy light bulbs and a thermostat. Great buy Out of the box this was easy to set up and even easier to use Was a little difficult to sync the first time. I really have only used the Tap to play music and to ask for the weather. I like that the device takes up little space in my kitchen. Easy to use, responds quickly, great screen brightness. Pleased with all the features. Amazon did another fantastic job with bringing great sound inna small package. It\\'s perfect for me when I\\'m doing homework or just surfing the web when I\\'m at a Starbucks or just at home. Purchased as a gift, perfect for small children! Easy to use especially for children\\'s apps with the touch screen. This is my 2nd tablet and it works great with downloading Great at home but still trying to figure out what apps work not connected to wifi I can read books, listen to books, go on facebook, shop, search the web almost anything on my brand new Kindle Fire!! My daughter loves this kindle, she does so much with it,well worth the money. Love it, works better than anticipated. Also at a good price All data from previous Kindle self loaded and was a seamless transition from old to new unit. So we gave it to my 1yr old for christmas, on the box it says if you break any way theyll replace, 30sec after opening he throws it down and jumps on .... works great lol loves watching spongbob on lol Such a cool product. We primarily use it for music‚Äî definitely rivals brand name speakers, but can be used for so much more I bought this for my 6 year old daughter, it has been great. I can set time limits I can set it so she has to do educational stuff before play and I can have weekend time set different from the week days. The protective case is durable , perfect for my clumsy child. I very happy with the product. I would recommend this for kids ages 6 to 10. They can play al kinds of games that can be downloaded Love the new video version ! Easy to setup and great to use! Works great. Easy to use. Fast. Great for the whole family. This was gift for my step son. It is easy to use and set up. I can read just about any book that is published and not leave my house to go to the store and have to buy them. Got this for my wife and she loves it. She had the previous generation and this one is a giant keep forward. Bought eh Echo Plus on a whim - it was on sale and I figured, \"why not.\" I am really enjoying it. Apart form the basic news and weather reporting, I enjoy my morning trivia. I also use the music from Amazon a lot. It\\'s been nice having a \"holiday\" station at my disposal. The Echo Plus is easy to set up and use and definitely has a lot of features, many of which I am still learning. My kids love their amazon kindles! They can take them anywhere and play on them! Great battery life! is very good product and the difiitioin is very good thanks love the worry free guarantee since this has been dropped several times. with that being said this tablet hs held up .Great resolution. Camera quality not so good tho. Gave it one less star for the camera. But overall its a great tablet Bought this for my two yr old and she loves it not to mention super durable. Bought the eco show to replace my first gen eco (the original tube). The show hears and understands me a lot better. Bought this tablet for my five-year-old son he plays it every single day loves it great kid friendly tablet I can lock the screen so he can\\'t mess anything up while I\\'m playing him an educational video plus built in case to handle and accidents this tab is golden This is my second Alexa and the second time set up so much easier. I love the extra volume for my music and the peer to peer calling gives me a mini hands free intercom. Still discovering the new features. Thanks. We really like this tablet . It\\'s easy to use This product is great. I wish there was a way to play music from my phone other than Bluetooth only. Bought for a family memeber and he was so happy with the game I would recommend this to a friend is anybody with little kids Wife wanted this gift and it did not disappoint, it\\'s the next step in Amazon\\'s capabilities, adding visual to the sound that was already there. it is smaller than i thought but it gets the job done. This devices is great for storing all my amazon books. It is also very light and portable. Simple to use as well. This tablet is great, and it has a good battery life. I\\'d recommend for people who love to read. Nice reader. Light weight. Clear display! Portable Bought this for my niece and she loves it. Very easy to use from what she tells me! I really haven\\'t had a chance to use this much yet, but it seems like a coll little gadget. Good for toddlersEasy to carryEasy to download I\\'ve purchased a number of Kindle Fire products for family over the past several years and continue to use them. Easy to use for even my youngest Grandchildren or my 87 year old Mother-In-Law which they use as a reader and for games. An overall good value. I had bought this tablet for my sister who is wheel chair bound or she lays in her bed. She gets a lot of Joy from using the tablet.Its big screen helps her see things better. Wife love it, reads a lot and this is her go to reader. Bought this tablet for my 2 &1/2 year old and it is perfect. Games and videos that come on it are very age appropriate and the tablet has been very durable thus far. Great little speaker I use it every day and I have it about for three days already We really are enjoying asking Alexa questions and she is connected to our Sonos system playing music around the house. She doesn‚Äôt always understand me. Not sure if it is her or me. My daughter loves playing with this. There are so many features, that it keeps her busy. This is great. The entire family is using it. Son‚Äôs are using it for it music, husband for appointments, me for just about everything. It‚Äôs useful and fun. It replaces my 6\" Fire Kindle. Love the HD quality. Great product. I‚Äôm at the beginning stages of having a smart home and this was the perfect addition. I love this little speaker. I can just voice activate an alarm time or ask Alexa the weather for the day. It\\'s amazing On sale & was purchased as a gift for Christmas, really great deal! I love that this is a real adult tablet with kids programming installed. Biggest downfall is that my son has trouble switching from app to app, otherwise I\\'d give it 5 stars. The pull up menu eat the bottom isn\\'t very responsive to his little hands. It\\'s simple and not difficult for young children to learn. Also is build sturdy in case it does get dropped more than a few times. This is great for learning for little kids. Easy set up. in about a hours time my 3 yrs grandson new how to navigate through the whole system. Well made for kids in mind. Amazing Sound! All around great product! Nothing negative so far. I was looking everywhere for this because I lost my charger for my fire stick and i finally found it at best buy. It was a great price and works perfectly! Awesome tablet! Love using it to read and surf the web. This is a great little tablet for my son. It is easy for him to navigate through and it also has parental controls . I can control how long he uses it and what he reads. Awesome tablet. Purchased for kids. They love it.. I have been contemplating purchasing an Echo product for some time now. I finally did it and I am so pleased I did. It was extremely easy to set up. I add my lights to the process and now it is so easy to turn lights on before I get to the room. For me, I know this will be the tip of the iceberg. I will now start looking at what else I can add to the Echo. Love the product. Great Buy!!! I bought the tablet for my 2 year grand daughter. The system comes with a set of kid friendly games and allows you to put the tablet on kid mode.. this keeps her in the \"safe zone\". I also installed ABC Mouse. Another hit program Great tablet for kids to learn puzzles and letters. Has tons of activities for children and a full tablet for adults perfect if you have pime! Perfect thing I needed to read books on and play my games Godchild loves it. He works it very well. Haven\\'t had any problems Got this for my wife and she loves it. Compact library on the go for an avid reader. My wife really enjoys the amazon fire. Has very good picture quality. Very easy to figure out how to use because its similar to our smart phone. Bought for sons & family they have small children and I never miss out on seeing them live .. love it I love Alexa although sometimes she has a hard time understanding so I find myself repeating commands such as ‚ÄúAlexa turn off lights in bedroom‚Äù . Overall she‚Äôs amazing and she tells jokes and very up to date with current events I love Alexa...She has become my best friend. Thanks A nice \"next step\" in the Alexa repertoire; easy to set up and to use. Overall good product, does what is advertised, comfortable to use. This tablet has it all. Amazon offers tons of free apps, hundreds of thousands of free e-books and tons of free games. The tablet is intuitive and intelligent. I seamlessly enjoy streaming my favorite shows and reading articles, books and periodicals. What I love most is that the tablet doesn\\'t place all apps on the device, but uses the users miro SD card instead for up to 200GB of additional storage for a dizzying amount of storage for more games, apps, books and movies that can be downloaded and enjoyed. It also allows the owner to share the device with family members, delegating each member an account personalized and tailored to that individual. There is even an option to create children\\'s accounts--extra bonus. I am able to mirror the content from the tablet onto my Samsung Smart television. I will definitely consider Amazon first and foremost when making any future tablet purchases. It maintains a charge for a good deal of time, alleviating the need to be near an outlet to enjoy using it. I can charge it in the evening and use it for several hours the next day, sometimes two days. No one will ever create a tablet that is more considerate of the owner/end-user. Bought this for my granddaughter for Christmas. She is special needs and so far she shows an interest in the movies and games included on this tablet. She is able to easily use it with minimum assistance. lightweight and convenient to use. love my new kindle Haven‚Äôt set it up yet but really looking forward to using it. I have a regular Alexa and love that ,so This should be even better! The only problem I have is have to recharge battery every 4-5 hrs. Other than that is a great item !! My daughter love this tablet! Easy to use and carry The Amazon tablet series has come along way since it first came out. The screen on the Fire HD 10 is stunning. Clear and easy to read. If used to android apps though, may be disappointed that some of your favorite apps will not be available on this tablet. This tablet is really easy to use and since I\\'m a Amazon Prime member the video\\'s and music is easy to access. I\\'m really surprised how fast the unit compared to my older i-pad. I would recommend this if anyone wants a good value product. I know this makes us lazy. But comes in handy when your hands are tied up with groceries or holding a baby. Love that my kids ask her questions. Bought this for our son for Christmas. He uses it in his room and loves it. Alexa also wakes him up for school in the morning. My daughter loves her new tablet. Plenty of games and videos to watch I am so impressed with this tablet. My seven year old loves its app, gaming and e-reader functions. I use most of Amazon services (Prime, Kindle, Music, Video, Alexa) and this is the best companion to access all services seamlessly. This tablet also has great features/expansion and performance. We love that even our four year old can tell Alexa to \"call papa\" or Alexa turn on the kitchen lights! The echo plus has been great .easy to set up and work.its all I thought it would be and more ,love it Good product with very nice price. Love it! Will return again. The echo show works very well with Bluetooth and WiFi. Great sound and screen. Recommend to anyone The Fire HD8 strikes an excellent balance between performance and price. It has many of the features you\\'d want in a tablet for a fraction of the cost. Works flawlessly for reading and video streaming. We love the Echo II. Its an awesome product. Great price too I bought this for our kitchen where we enjoy cooking and congregating. Streaming music is great and you can search for recipes just by asking Alexa. I‚Äôm still trying to get it set up but so far it‚Äôs a blast! I think that the Amazon Kindle tablet was a great purchase for my teenage daughter and grandson, very easy to operate. It kept them entertained for hours while we were traveling on the train for vacation. This make an excellent ebook reader. Don\\'t expect much from this device except to read basic ebooks. The good thing is it\\'s cheap and good to read in the sun. My 5 year old granddaughter cannot put her Fire tablet down. My granddaughter plays a variety of games and watches videos. She loves her tablet! I love this tablet,I use it for school readings ,for my philosophy class , my Mac book is to delicate to take to school,but my fire tablet is perfect ! I purchased this for my daughter and when I tell you she was so happy she hugged the box then me and back to the box! I don\\'t know why it takes long to come on and it goes off on me my kids have no problem I bought this for my daughter to use. I know the regular amazon fire is cheaper, but this one came with a bumper, a two year no question warranty and a one year subscription to free time which allows kids to read lot of books and play great games for free. In the end it\\'s a great deal. I have a 4 year old boy and 6 year old girl and 12 year old boy no cracks or broken yet yes they have dropped them no case but no cracks yet pretty amazing when they drop it on hard wood floors and still not broke!! Got this for the family and we all love it. Great gift It\\'s a very good tablet for your child everyday use This works great. I read a LOT and I needed something that would handle all my eBooks. It has all the other bells and whistles as any tablet but I use it for the eBooks and one game. Excellent! It has been a great product for our son. Easy to use and excellent for learning and playing games. Video quality is very good as well. This was a request from our 7 yr old granddaugter who had always asked her older sister if she could share hers due to we bought this same tablet/size a few yrs earlier. Loved the security/parental control options.Starfall a favorite educational app were told is a must have. Really enjoy Pics/Viber due to their in a different state. Also some games on a time limit. Size and resolution are perfect. From her jokes, rapping and everyday new fact Alexa is awesome. Its super easy to pull out your phone to check the weather but i honestly never did and would always be surprised when i walked outside with whatever it is that day. But every morning i ask alexa whats the weather and she gives me an in depth review for that day and the rest of the week. There are tons of skills for Alexa most useful some random. But shes a must try. Also plus about the echo plus is if you want to start a smart home you dont need a hub like the other echo pieces. You can just buy some compatible smart bulbs. Upgrading from an older Kindle. Wow. Lighter. Crisper text is an understatement. Throw in the lighting and the new interface for page advancement. Pricey but if you want the best, you won\\'t be disappointed. Has what is necessary for the average individuals needs. Works great very easy to install made connecting other devices even easier This tablet is very kid friendly. You log on the tablet and the kids is having fun... We purchased this Amazon Fire - Kids Edition for my 3 year-old granddaughter. Could not have made a better choice! She was up and running in no time and absolutely loves it.In fact, when my wife (who has an older model Fire tablet) started playing with it, she was so impressed with its capabilities that she now wants one for herself.Very pleased with our purchase! I bought this device for my wife. She has been using a Kindle Fire 7.I wanted something with a bigger screen for her.She likes it very much. I love the tablet and would buy it again and would tell my family and friends about the fire tablet We are so happy with our Alexa! We are very technologically challenged but she‚Äôs been great! Had a prob with original one I purchased and Bedt Buy replaced it hassle free I bought this tablet for my 8 year old granddaughter. She loves it!!! The display is very clear and easy to see. The set up allows for you to choose child safe settings with PIN protected parent lock to help protect young users from inappropriate content. This is well worth the affordable cost! Added Alexa hub and expanded the lighting capabilities. Easy setup and it works like a charm. Looking for more devices to add to the mix! One For Us One For The Kids For Christmas!Great way to get connected! Really cool device! Instantly noticed the difference in quality when I switched from the regular Fire Stick to the Fire TV with 4k. My sister in-law recommended these to my wife and I and I thought I would try one. They are just the right size to lay in bed of a evening and read a good book for a while. This is actually my daughters device as I have no interest in a voice controlled spy. But, I will say that the sound from the speakers are pretty good for a small device. I love the Fire HD. Went back and bought the Fire 7\" for my wife that afternoon! I was an early adoptor of the Amazon Echo, when I heard they were releasing a mobile version I wanted it. It wasn\\'t until we spent a lot of time cleaning our old home before moving that we realized how usefule this lil guy was, just set it up to your phones wifi hotspot and you have a fully function Echo. I would buy this again if I didn\\'t already have one. I love the fact that is very practical and I didn\\'t have to spend a lot of money. Got me reading again! Love the merlot cover. This one is the smallest of all the kindle products I believe, and that\\'s a big reason I picked. Also the lightest I believe. Battery life is forever.Two negative points are the Amazon logo in the cover, and the fact you can\\'t do inverted text (black background white text).Those 2 points dropped it from 4 to 5 star for me.Still highly recommended. I am happy as i bought it for reading and it is good. We never received the light bulb. Very happy with Alexa just not happy that the bulb was not sent. I enjoy readi,g and Facebook using this item. I also purchased my husband one. Love it took the place off the echo in my bedroom. I\\'m loving my kindle. Early gift to myself. Happy! I bought this for my 6 year old daughter, it has been great. I can set time limits I can set it so she has to do educational stuff before play and I can have weekend time set different from the week days. The protective case is durable , perfect for my clumsy child. I very happy with the product. Great!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I bought this for my mom and dad they loved it. Thank you I love the show. It was so easy to set up. I use it every day for music and weather info. Can\\'y wait to see how it works for Christmas cookies. Works well. Easy to use. I like the auto on when you open the case We bought this to replace a Kindle Fire pad and they have come a long way in this build, I would recommend this or if you like a bigger one then get then10\" version. What a great ereader. Amazon continues its dominance in the ereader field with this entry. Light and comfortable to hold. Perfect combination of hepatic feedback buttons and adaptive back-lighting. Seems to stay charged forever even with regular use. I would definitely recommend this and would buy again. Just decent tablet... working fast, but it needs more language support and apps as well... It is nice to say one set of key words, and it kicks off a whole series of events. (Turn lights on, play music etc). Got it when it was on sale. Totally fall in love with it. Bring with it me everywhere. Very sleek design and very easy to use - nice graphics!!! I wanted to buy my mom a simple tablet that she could easily work. Great for beginners. Alexa is a wealth of knowledge and learning more and more every day. I bought two of these for Christmas for my 3 and 4 year old and they love them! Easy to navigate and it keeps them busy and interested for hours. Sturdy protective bumper protector keeps your kids Kindle safe. The only complaint I have is the charger doesn\\'t stay snug and one is already useless because it won\\'t fit tight enough to charge. This isn\\'t a problem with this Kindle but maybe all of them. I bought my oldest son a regular Kindle fire the same day and his charger is worthless now too. Not quite sure what the problem is with them. My son just love playing games on this tablet. Its easy and fun! Enjoy the performance and size of the television we purchased. We are very satisfied with this product This is a great value for the money. It is easy to use and has a lot of great features . In addition to the ability to read books on it, I can listen to music; play games and use it as a camera. It is a great value for the money. The screen is large enough to make reading easy. Got two for my kids for Christmas and they\\'re awesome! And also got lucky they scanned to $20 less than advertised price! Woo! Bought this as a Mother\\'s Day gift. Fits perfect inside her pocketbook for accessible use. I like this tablet, its thin, light and easy to use. It\\'s great for kids and adults as well. I bought this Kindle Paperwhite for my son to use at school, instead of his more expensive and delicate tablet. The display options make it adaptable for just about anyone, and is much easier on the eyes when reading for an extended period of time. Please keep in mind that this does not have a glowlight. The Kindle is durable, and although I bought a case for it, a case really isnt necessary if you are relatively careful with it. The most surprising thing about this has been the extra long battery life. My son is an avid reader, and noticed that he needs to charge his Kindle considerably less than when he uses his tablet. This is such a great addition to our house! Amazon Echo plus is incredible for all the things it is capable of doing. I have had a Kindle for some time and was curious about the Oasis. It did not disappoint. It is very compact, even with the cover, and fits in a coat pocket. I really enjoy the size and the redesign which brings back hard buttons. Great device for home or on the go. I love the Echo show. I have found so many uses such as weather updates, recipes and random questions. My grandkids love it for stories, songs, pictures and just being plain silly. I don\\'t think I\\'ve tapped into its full potential yet. I don\\'t think a person can go wrong with this purchase. The Tap is portable, has excellent sound quality and is a good value for the money. Video integration it\\'s big plus for video calling kids at home and quick check who\\'s at the door when doorbell rings. Just love it. Some very innovative. Very user friendly I\\'m a longtime Kindle user and jumped at the opportunity to bring my granddaughter into the fold with this gift. She loved it! I love the tablet....I just can\\'t do without the tabelt The best tablet for the price i use it everyday to watch youtube videos If you enjoy reading you will not find a better device. Excellent price for a product of this quality A fun little device on the cutting edge of consumer artificial intelligence. Sp aker sounds pretty good. Alexa does have some problems understanding how I ask questions a fair amount of the time. I have been a kindle owner since they first came out. This version has many,many more bells and whistles but I still use mine mostly for books, audible books and a place for me to download music I can listen to when I travel. Sometimes it is a bit slow opening up different apps and functions but overall it is functional, dependable and useful to me Like having another person in the house, I talk to Alexa more then my wife Speaker has great sound and it‚Äôs awsome that it syncs with other speakers to really fill your house with sound. The smart lights I wasn‚Äôt too sure of, but since I‚Äôve installed it I want to get more. It‚Äôs a great smarthome hub. My gf loved it and uses it all the time. She gets books she wanted to follow up on I love my Amazon Fire HD 8. It\\'s not too small and not too big. I was looking at other tablets, and decided on the Amazon Fire HD 8 because of the price, and because I have Amazon Prime, I purchased it online at Best Buy, and then picked it up at the store on Black Friday. It is my first tablet, and so I wanted to start with one that I can have fun with, and I am. I do have a laptop for important things. Bought one for Living Room and the other for the bedroom. Home wifi needs to be boosted but Alexa would connect through out which caused complications along with Bluetooth speakers. Once straightened out works great. Moved all the ad apps to a folder and loaded what I wanted. Small size fits in my sport coat pocket. It is amazing that you can get this much tech for such a low price. This thing does everything I need, and it\\'s so much faster than my old Kindle. This was a gift for my friend. My friend likes it, I wouldn\\'t buy something like this for this much money. The screen is small. I bought this tablet for myself because I bought the 8 gb one for my 6 year old and was so impressed with it that I bought myself the 16 gb one I love my Amazon Echo! Alexa is compatible with all of my technology and super easy to use. My favorite is the ease of making a grocery list and having it in the app instead of forgetting my list at home. Love this tablet. Bought it to be my touch screen remote for my harmony hub, but use it for so much more now. Bought this for my wife. She is a constant reader and put away her previous Kindles for this one. She now has internet access also, so she can find more books anytime she wants. This Echo has great sound for such a a small device. It is easy to set up and use. I am finding new tasks Alexa can do each day. This screen on the hd8 is a huge improvement over the past kindle or fire devices. The operating system is sometimes glitchy, but overall a nice system for the money. The best Kindle I have ever used. It does everything. My children really enjoy this tablet. We have tried other brand tablets and those were not too kid friendly, even though they were kid tablets, and I found them a little advanced for my children\\'s ages. So this tablet was perfectly age appropriate, and with a bigger memory than the previous, no complaints. I love this tablet. Works great for my needs. Ebooks Facebook light gaming. Internet is a little slow but it\\'s $40 what can I say. I installed Google chrome for more apps. Amazon hit it out of the park with this one. I am able to connect this to NEST cams and Ring cams as well. Songs come with lyrics, sound and looks great. Even though the ppi is lower than the other tablets I didn\\'t really notice it. I like the letterbox format which allows the use of more of the screen area when viewing movies and TV. I purchased this for my children who are separated by miles. Can\\'t wait for them to open their gifts I purchased this as a second Alexa. Couldn\\'t figure out why it came with the Hue Light bulb until I learned that the new version of Alexa has a built-in hub. It\\'s a gift for my spouse, but I can\\'t wait to set it up and get more bulbs to automate our home lighting. This is a very good reader for the money. Very versatile. My son loves it. He now wants to add more for Alexa to use. I am really enjoying my new kindle fire hd 8. The picture is awesome even for a movie. I use it mostly to read with an occasional game or movie too. Colors are great and the size of the screen is very nice. I have a 7 inch fire and there is enough size difference for movies etc to make it worthwhile. Plus there was a great black Friday price. Awesome all around product - great picture and like the voice control. Much sleeker and touch response is better. Even wifi connection seems faster might be due to new processor and increase in RAM I bought this as a light-weight alternative to an iPad for collecting and enjoying Kindle and Amazon Video products. When combined with the dedicated Fire cover, it\\'s low price along with a very readable screen and the option for a Micro SD card make it an excellent choice for travel and time spent in waiting-rooms, etc., allowing lots of memory space for ones library as well as flexibility regarding how it is held or positioned. Gave this to my son who breaks everything and so far has lasted through a couple drops. Easy to use and upload content. Bought this for my parents to use with their Amazon prime account. Sure they will love it. Really love my Fire HD. Very easy to browse the internet. Is an excellent EBook Reader. Amazon apps are great! Amazon - Fire HD8 - 8 - Tablet - 16GB - Wi-Fi - Black I purchased this for my sister. I really appreciate the Geek Squad for setting this product up for her and for teaching me how to use it. Now I can pass that I learned onto my sister. Great for reading e-mail, pictures or viewing internet. Love the echo plus. Easy to set up with comparable extras, has simplified so many things in my home. Takes some getting to use to but patience and practice and males all the difference. Purchased, took home, attached to cable,plugged in. Easy to use. No problems using this charger. Great to have for time, recipe, or entertainment I recommend everyone get it This is a pretty substantial tablet, lots of learning apps and the ability to download Netflix is a plus We have the original Echo, two Echo Dots and the Echo Show to complete the family - love the ability to play videos and the lyrics display on Prime Music is awesome! I love my amazon fire tablet, I\\'m sure my kids will love theirs too! Easy to use and navigate, purchasing books is fast and simple and I love the fact that I can password protect this device This is great for the beach or by the pool. If you already own an Echo, this is a great addition to the household. I use this every day on my commute. Great battery life, no backlight but very readable with normal lighting. I like the built in dictionary. Email yourself pdf or mobi files for easy transfers. This speaker has a great sound and its perfect to take out on the patio or in any room that I am in. The tap is annoying compared to the Echo with voice activation, but the wireless features makes the purchase worth it. Same as echo but with a screen which adds to the appeal to this product. Asking trivia questions of Alexa is a hoot but being able to turn off the ceiling fan from bed is golden. Ok so i normally do not like this kind of stuff, but to be honest Alexa has been great, not only do we use it for fun stuff like music while cooking, or being able to multi task much easier, it fit in seamlessly with our home security system, added a extra cam, and really does add something extra to the home Lot to learn, but great device. Connecting to other devices can be frustrating, but over time should be better. Connect to my Bose blue tooth speaker, then tried the dot. Seems connection can be to only one device at a time. Still checking help app but limited info. Excellent sound and fun. Very portable and easy to carry in backpack. All the features of Echo and Echo Dot but you must \"Tap\" the button before speaking. Using for Pandora in an office setting. Set up with older system and speaker system - works great. Nice except unlike a Google Home you can‚Äôt just ask it to play music. You eventually have to purchase their music after s free trial Great price and works great for book reading. Would recommend Bought 4 devices for my kids... they report its simple to start up, easy to use and fun! Love my new I Pad, and New TV for my kitchenAlso bought 3 Alexa with pods for my family at xmas Bought this for my cousins and he absolutely loves it. Great product easy to use and would recommend to anyone Purchased the Echo Plus after reading that the new generation had been upgraded by improving the sound and integration of a controller. For the price provided, I thought that the deal was a good value. I have the first generation unit as well. A quick comparison of the two from a sound, look, etc perspective really didn\\'t lead me to think that there was any noticeable sound improvement nor improved aesthetics. At least the price for the unit has come down quite a bit and the addition of Philips bulb for \\'free\\' was a smart move.Overall, I think that the unit is a good purchase for beginning some home automation projects. This is just what I was looking for. It does just what it says it does! Great item and easy to use. Very helpful and entertaining Got for my parents as a gift. Simple to use and they like it. Got on sale so was good value. Great tablet with a lot of features. Great price too. I have an Amazon Prime account so I started downloading apps and playing all kinds of music on this. I also can control my Hue hub (you need one for certain timers and things) and Wemo plus outlets for my non wifi lights and LED\\'s in the kitchen cabinets. It\\'s great to some extent but I was expecting more. It\\'s unfortunate that it does not work with lots of apps. Perhaps I\\'m not using them correctly. I\\'m still learning. Our grand kids really love this tablet and it has a lot of app options. My son thoroughly enjoys having this tablet, and I love the protective case that comes with it. I love this unit. Very well designed and built. It\\'s very easy to use and has a huge amount of features. The screen is beautiful, but the audio could use a bit more bass IMHO. I bought 3 for Christmas gifts. Purchased this as a gift for my wife because her B&N Nook was dying. She absolutely loves it, especially since it does so much more. I\\'m now waiting for my Nook to start acting up so that I have an excuse to get a Kindle for myself. Didnt know how much i\\'d use a kindle so went for the lower end. im happy with it, even if its a little dark My granddaughters love the Kid Kindles that they received for Christmas! I love my tablet. It is super easy and loads fast. I already has an older version of the Kindle, but this one is even better. I love the touch screen and the ability to scroll without buttons. Bought second one for my mom and she loves it so much Love this. Just replaced my old echo with this one. Love Alexa. I have both a 1st gen Echo and now the new Echo Plus. I am impressed with the sound quality improvement, especially the bass. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, it‚Äôs no Bose system but it sounds great for every day use. I just like reading amd playing games on it..Better then those bulky computers Got it when it was on sale. Totally fall in love with it. Bring with it me everywhere. Will definitely keep buying Kindle fire from Best buy The Echo is a great addition for my busy household. The voice commands to play music is excellent. The fact I can sit on my couch and control the lights and other items just by saying what i want is just amazing. Great tablet for the kids to play games and watch shows. this is so much better than the echo dot. the smart hub is pretty cool I previously purchased two of these for two other grandkids and they just love them and so does mom. She can set time limits, can limit access, and much more. Plus it comes with a two year guarantee , if the child breaks it, they will replace it. Did I mention that there is a sd expansion card slot to increase the storage capacity. These grandkids are 4 to 8 in age, but older kids would enjoy this also. I love my amazon show it‚Äôs a recommended product if you wanna have this item. However the down sides are it has a great speaker so if it‚Äôs full max it may be hard for Alexa to hear you. Another downside google hates amazon = not YouTube. Bought for wife who is not into the techie word. She likes it - suggest buying a protective screen and padded case for it. Salesman told me the big one was better so I bought it. My daughter gave me the small one for Christmas. Does the same thing. Salesmen are apparently undertrained or a bunch of liars! I love everything about it, except the glare. Great product though, easy to use, great movie quality as well. I just wish I could read it on the beach. Works great! I am looking forward to purchase more for the diffrent rooms in my house. This product works great. I really enjoy having Alexa follow commands I have had every kindle since the first and this is by far the best. The screen was already great on the Voyage but the front light on this screen is more white and more evenly distributed. Physical page turn buttons are so much better than none or the haptic feedback type. They didn\\'t include the automatically adaptive front light for some reason but I don\\'t think I\\'ll miss it much as I was always wont to fiddle with it on the Voyage anyway.But this device made me smile as soon as I held it for the first time because it has a larger bezel that you can really grip comfortably without touching the screen. Maybe this isn\\'t a big deal for most, but that is exactly why I spent the money to get this device.The other thing I was hoping for was the ability to use the upper page turn button to go forward and this device does that and even better because it is software configurable.The cover is very small and light and doesn\\'t add much bulk like the Voyage Origami case does. The only downside is that it doesn\\'t work as a hands free stand for reading.(I still wish it was waterproof) Had to get this tablet it was a great price and came with free amazon movies for a year, I just had to change the case. Bought as a Christmas gift. Works good with no problems I will have one for all my rooms. I will also buy some for friends This is the best kindle ereader yet. The size and weight make it perfect for comfortable reading. You will find yourself reading more books than ever with it. What I like is it its sound, it\\'s portable and I use it at work. The sound fills the whole office. Omg I love my amazon show it is sooo cool and does a lot of cool stuff Purchased this for a gift for my mother who is a amazon fanatic she loves it ! Made her christmas this year So yesterday evening i decided to purchase an Amazon Echo. Is the machine intrusive yeah i guess it could be if you allow it. I purchased it because of its home automation and other fantastic capabilities. Just to name a few of those capabilities. With a subscription you will have an unprecedented amount of music you can listen to, that in itself was worth it. Some other things include sports travel recipes and traffic. The home automation part lock doors turn on lights random lighting when on vacation.. I have the HD 7 and an HDX 7, and the 8 outperforms them both. If you are an Amazon fan of the eco system, this is a must. The screen is bright and crisp. The processor performs very well with the latest software update. I love it. I LOVE MY ECHO SHOW, ELEXA IS SO HELPFULL SHE ANSWERS JUST ABOUT EVERY QUESTION I HAVE This item is a great addition to your smart home, but just as the first gen Siri it is not all there yet. The kinks still needs to be worked out. Alexa does not have answers to a lot of things or commands. There\\'s a long learning curve. Setting up with apps is a lot work. It\\'s fun if your large circle is willing to spend the money to get one each. Great landline replacement. Awesome so far. Have used it as alarm clock, stereo, 2nd screen for movies (while multitasking on PC), news/weather, audiobooks, and more. The news flash can repeat itself at times, but I may have subscribed to too many subcategories, but a quick alexa - next skips right ahead. Still learning the variations of commands, and sometimes it hears what it wants to until I have to ar. tic. u. late. to the point of annoyance, but hey, this is still relatively new tech, and who would have imagined this 20 years or more ago this is a very good product, the speakers are good, the price was right. I liked everything about it, other than the fact that you had to press the button each time you wanted to talk to it, unlike the echo and the dot. The portability was good, but I didn\\'t have much use for it being portable. Unless you are going to keep the Tap within arm\\'s reach, you\\'re better off with one of the other hands free voice activated products. recommended with caveats This thing is really cool, love that it gives all the words to songs Love it Love it Love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! My 5 year old son loves his kindle. He can fully work it himself. We love all the he age appropriate games, learning apps, and books. The case is great for all those accidentally drops. I bought this as a gift for my sister and every time I see her she is using it. She does not have a computer or internet at home and is very dependent on the library. This works so well for her. A stop anywhere there is free wifi and she is online. So much tech utility for such a low price. Reciever of this really likes and and says its a step up from the fire hd7, so I guess that is what counts. It is easy for little ones to use. Great beginner buy. I purchased this tablet mostly for entertainment. I enjoy playing games and this tablet is great for that purpose. Also plan on using it for reading electronic books. I absolutely love this product. It does so many things not the least of which is music. Ask it anything and it will answer. Extra features don‚Äôt really seem worth it. I would just buy the basic one instead Good tablet, satisfied. One point annoying...silk browser makes Yahoo email a list and have to tap HTML to read each one...Awkward. purchased for my sister for reading books, internet and games - perfect for beginners and novices. Easy to use. Would be a five if available with 4g It\\'s so fantastic to just ask a device to turn on lights, or play music. So convenient. Love this! My daughter bought this with her birthday money. She loves it and is always playing it. he echo show is great. I can use it to monitor my outside inside cameras. This is a great reader, it feels like the best evolution of the Paperwhite. The auto-brightness works fine and is unnoticeable and it feels good in the hands. The new page squeeze feature is nice as is the haptic feedback when you squeeze the bezel.The power button is also much better placed now and the glass screen makes swiping and tapping the bookmark and location corner areas much easier. The backlight is now much more uniform than my 1st gen Paperwhite.The only issue I have is when displaying black blocks like the tree silhouette, I have what looks like a tiny bad pixel that kind of twinkles. And of course, this thing is expensive when compared to the Paperwhite. I love this tablet. One of the best out there on the market. Video quality is very good. Works well with Amazon Prime Video and Music - no surprises there. Apps are VERY disappointing - many common apps are not available - even though there are Android versions! Not bad if you have modest expectations. Like having pictures and weather on the screen and news up dates It\\'s was on sale on this color,put the play store and made it real Android tablet Boxed well, easy to set up, and pretty easy to get the hang of. Bought for my wife to upgrade from the original Kindle that she has worn out. Big step up from the original and should be good for another 8-10 years. Gave as Christmas gift,and wife loved it. She has not put it down since she has gotten it. Good item for children and is very inexpensive. Easy to hold and has a cover designed for it. For the money I highly recommended it. It is great when linked to Netflix, Disney Movies, etc I looked at multiple other brands, some cheaper by 20-40 bucks. This is the only one that guarantees your kid cant break it for 2 years!!!! Drinks have spilled on it, its been dropped, thrown sat on and not a thing wrong with it. Love Alexa especially the touch screen - can play games- like Jeopardy I had trouble linking to my Joule Cooking App, finally got on the third day. I Love it now, still is learning Voice Recognition though Super easy to set up and use :)Got one for daughter and got one for self!!!!!! My 3 yr old son loves his tablet. He takes it almost everywhere and it keeps him entertained. Love this product, super easy to use and able to have a lot of fun with this with entertaining guests and ourselves. the future of reading you just have this and it is like a whole library Received an Echo Plus as a Christmas present. Absolutely love it. We went back & purchased a Dot & more light bulbs. Nice tablet for my 8 year old daughter! Affordable! Charging battery can be frustrating at time. Normally have to hit power button to turn off and back on after you plug into outlet to charge or it will take many hours to charge. It is almost like it allows the tablet to reset to charge. Good for convenience when other devices are tied up, but the keyboard lags a little slower than I would like. good tablet for the price its quick and easy to use This was a Black Friday special and we knew we wanted a smart home assistant and Alexa worked well with the Ring doorbell system. There are times when you have to ask her the same thing over and over until she figures it out but overall it was a food deal. I HAVE BOTH THE ECHO AND THE TAP, THEY ARE SPECTACULAR so far so good,,,, wife very happy. misses her old one.... Excellent product.Relable.Maximum speed.Fast downloading Love the shopping lists feature, listening to music ... having so much fun Great price for product. It\\'s get of you have kids. I or a family member have owned every version of the Kindle since it came out. This version has finally taken all of the best elements of the previous Kindles and combined them into one unit. It is small and light, has both touch screen and button functionality (depending on which you prefer - I\\'m a fan of the buttons), and an excellent back-light. Kindle battery life has always been excellent, and is no different here. I use my Kindle daily, often for at least an hour at a time. The only downside is that I\\'m not sure what other features Amazon could add to improve this version, other than perhaps making it lighter weight. By far the best e-reader out there, and a worthy upgrade from a previous version My grandson really enjoyed this product. Good deal. I have not had a chance to use the HUB function on this device, but it was easy to set up and get running, still learning how to make it work with the other echo devices, but overall it operates as advertised. Easy to use and love all the things I can do on it. Have been using my kindle app on my iPad for years but now can\\'t Imagine using anything besides my kindle to read. Love the backlight so I can read at night. This fit my criteria of a low cost tablet that works well My grandson loved this. He is 4 and it was perfect. I love this Kindle!! I am biased I think however I have had 3 previous ones I prefer Kindles to any other tablet I bought this about a month ago and I really like it. The best part is light in weight, sound is very good for small gathering like on the deck or camping and it comes with Batterey charger. The voice command activation is so great to have and listen all my music plus worldwide radios from TuneIn. this is excellent for kids 3-7. the only thing I don\\'t like is it is difficult to go to kids web pages by typing in an web address once you set up the kids profile, plus it takes away the easy access of the camera which the kids love. I may have set it up wrong as it did not come with printed instructions and I am not tech savvy. This item is extremely durable and great fun for the kids. I love the tablets HD picture is beautiful. The fire tablet is very fast to load and is easy to use. Great tablet. I bought my Fire HD8 as an alternative to carrying around my laptop and having to buy many textbooks for college. The fact that I saved well over $150 on one of the 5 books I had to get this semester was a godsend. Most all undergraduate courses I have seen are offered in eBook form for Kindle. If you do not care about having the constant ability of being on the internet without WiFi or other hotspot, it\\'s a great resource. Pros:Price for this was still less than the money saved for my Biology Book.A lot less weight that 5 college textbooks.So far all books I need for college are available as eBooks through Amazon.A single charge can make it through an 8 hour school day.Cons:If you want/need a network connection, you have to use your phone as a hotspot or connect to another WiFi network. Bottom line, I wanted a cheaper alternative to having to lug over $750 in books around. I came out at well under $500 considering I bought this. I have several around the house and love playing music on them Just love this tablet.does everything teenage grandson needs it to do! I also buy one for my granddaughter! I really missed my first kindle when my husband gave me a fire 2 years ago. I love to read outside and could not do that with a fire. The voyage is perfect, easy to read anywhere, much longer battery life than a fire. Very happy with it and the buttons are easy to use or you can just tap the screen to turn the page. Great for my kids and is easy to block purchases. Even better if you have amazon prime. Can charge and take anywhere in the house! Holds a long charge. I needed a second charger (for traveling) for my Kindle Fire that was a fast charger. This worked great. It charges my Kindle fire in just a few hours. This is by far the best reader for all lighting environments. The only drawback I see are the constant ads when you log on to the device, and the library interfaceneeds to be more intuitive. However, I\\'m very satisfied with my purchase and use of this Voyage. I\\'ve already read over six books with it in just 3+ weeks. For being such a small, affordable tablet, it has all the features and apps you need plus perfect size for reading books. And the best part part is it fits in almost any purse! Easy to use. Very lightweight. Would recommend to anyone I really enjoy reading. So much so I was running out of shelf space. I have read a few books with my I-pad mini but it really didn\\'t do the trick. No so with my new Amazon Fire Hd-8. Handy sized, not the least bit heavy and super bright. Add in the face that digital material from magazines to novels are often as not far cheaper that \"hard copies\". I love my echo so easy to hook up and great sound quality Moved all the ad apps to a folder and loaded what I wanted. Small size fits in my sport coat pocket. Was a gift to replace older one and she really likes this one. Light and the battery last much longer. If you want a certain level of privacy and at the same time a speech enabled assistant, then this is the product for you. The Tap only listens to your, when you push the \"button, otherwise it is deaf to its surroundings. You get the awesome power of Alexa, provided by Amazon, and no worries about anyone listening to you surreptitiously. I never thought that buying this product was such a great step up. Really makes watching a movie and turning on the TV so easy, really works well with my harmony hub. Love the way I can control all the lights. Looking forward to all the add ons, I can purchase. My 3 1/2 year old grandson son LOVES this \"big game\" as he calls it. I have several home automation devices and the Echo Plus controls all of them. I was so happy with automation, I bought an Echo Dot and Echo Tap. The kindle was great but too small for my vision impaired mother, it was a gift, I have not been a fan of anything Android, but Amazon did this one right. I\\'ve had none of the issues I\\'ve experienced with other Android tablets, and it works great for shopping, browsing, reading, and listening to music. Got it for our grandson for Christmas and he won\\'t put it down. Comes with free kids software which is great. This tablet was an upgrade from the Nabi Jr for my 4 year old and she really enjoys it. There are so many apps/books/videos and it entertains her much more. The only thing i would recommend is getting an additional storage product since there isnt much internally. She likes to read books and this is a fast and cheap way for her to do so For the price guy cannot beat it great for watching videos or streaming television. Works great and nice links to Amazon if you have a prime account. I thoroughly enjoy reading on this. That is the main reason I bought it and it fits nicely in my purse. Reminded my son and I of his old early generation Kindle that worked so well. I have a couple of iPads and decided to get this for general browsing, movie watching etc. Very pleased with the overall package. An added bonus is the very nice Amazon integration. Awesome.. Everything I need and more. I\\'m very happy with the tablet.I\\'m very happy.Thank you,Kathleen Stroyek I use this all the time for playing games and reading books, it\\'s great for surfing the web too. For two girls that love to play games and take with them This tablet has been so good that I bought 4 so far.All my nephews and nieces have one and they are loving it. This is a great tablet without the steep cost of an iPad. I haven\\'t used it too much so far but the picture and sound is pretty good and being able to stream movies/shows is quite nice. This tablet is small, compact and easy to handle. It\\'s easy to figure out the main functions. My one complaint is that it does not support some big apps such as Dropbox or Google Drive. I am so happy with this product. It is so helpful to use st any time of the day. I.can do things while I am lying in bed definitely recommend this product i bought an amazon fire 7 tablet for my 7 year old granddaughter and she loves it. it is easy to operate and charge. purchased for a capstone team to test and review how it would benefit today\\'s journalist. Very satisfied. Price was great. The curved screen is nice but I believe you get more TV with straight screen. I believe it is just a viewers choice. We have a sound system so I can\\'t speak about the sound. Exactly what I needed. Didn\\'t want to settle for a generic off brand charger. Thanks to Best Buy I didn\\'t have to. Absolutely love this. We got the lights and they have worked so great. Looking for a reader with some basic tablet functions. This was just that. We have Alexa and now a video version of recipes and more. Love it! This kindle has made life easier by adding the micro sd card slot to enhance the memory capacity up to 128gb more than it has built in, makes it easy to switch cards so you can have your whole library on hand without slowing down the overall processing capability Got one for my 4yr old. She loves it. It\\'s very durable. I love that I can switch accounts and use it for myself too. I use my Kindle fire HD 10 in 3 ways 1 for reading Kindle books, 2 for streaming TV shows or movies while riding my exercise bike, 3 to surf the internet. Im happy to have it. Very comfortable and easy to use every where Bought this for my mom as an upgrade to her older non-HD Kindle Fire and it is an improvement on all fronts - bigger better screen, better speakers, faster processor and updated operating system plus a slot for external storage. Great price for what you get. alexa is awesome and screen makes her even better can\\'t wait to get another Great upgrade/replacement. No problems with it at all. Bought this for my 3 year old and it is great. Wish it had a bit more storage but overall very happy with my purchase. This was a gift for a 4 year old who was enjoying it immediately with very little adult assistance required. Haven\\'t used it myself, but probably won\\'t, its for kids! Good purchase. No need for Philips hue bridge, I still purchased bridge as I use multiple Echo dots as well. Purchased for my 87 year old mother as a safety/convenience, entertainment device. She loves it! finds it easy to use, loves to have music throughout the house. It\\'s a very reliable tablet for the little ones. Most enjoyable feature is how you can control everything they look at and what kind of apps they use. Good tablet. Gave as gift and person enjoys it. Recommend My granddaughter loves her tablet toddler friendly I am enjoying the Echo Show a lot.Very entertaining My grandkids love it. They use it at home and when we travel. This is the music lovers best friend. My wife and kids love asking Alexa to play ANY song. The sound quality is great I bought this as a gift. They love it! It is really helpful to have around the house. Great product. The Amazon Fire HD8 tablet is a high quality, inexpensive piece of technology that works great for anyone looking to purchase one that won\\'t break the bank. Love the echo show & the ability to communicate with smaller children without any effort or cell phones. Great..I love it..Glad I got it..My nephew loves it. The product is very entertaining and useful. Would recommend it to anyone. Very happy with adding Alexa to the kitchen! The Echo Show is great for looking up recipes, getting a weather and traffic up as I‚Äôm getting my morning coffee or just listening to music! I love my Amazon Fire tablet, I bought this all the while knowing that people had negative reviews... But honestly I don\\'t know what they did to theirs because mines doesn\\'t have any issues... I\\'ve had mines for over a month and still working perfectly like I just bought it yesterday... I purchased it for my dad (70)He needed something easy to use. He really enjoys it. Very easy to setup. Had no issues at all . Nice having hub inside . Bulb sync was a breeze If you really want to have a good read on something digital this is the item you\\'re looking for. It really is lightweight and highly functional. The battery lasts a long time and the screen is easy on the eyes. The only difficulty sometimes is reading in extremely bright environments. Overall an excellent buy. fast, easy to use, very sensitive, google play store captable, I will buy again Got two for my kids for Christmas and they\\'re awesome! And also got lucky they scanned to $20 less than advertised price! Woo! Bought this for my six year old grandson. The set up was very easy. He is able to download kids only stuff and can send us videos of himself using the app. He just loves it. Truly kid friendly. I use this primarily as a reader; however, it has a smaller number of unread books that are not in the familiar \"carousel\" as in other Kindle readers. As a tablet it is faster, brighter and more clear than other tablets that I have used for internet purposes. I would recommend this product to anyone who uses a tablet or a reader. My Son absolutely loves this thing, very durable and comes with a great warranty. This has replaced my laptop for out and about. Easy to use. In addition, I can now read e books and listen to audio books. So convenient..... One of the things I love the most about my new Kindle is it\\'s size. It slides so nicely into my compact purse, protective case and all. Another thing I\\'ve noticed is the lack of glare that I experienced with my old Kindle. It automatically adjusts to the light and I\\'m looking forward to being able to read it on the beach without a struggle. I also love the battery life - it goes on forever. The case I bought makes it possible to stand my Kindle up in front of me and read while I\\'m eating - a must for me - I never eat alone ;) My daughter got this tablet for Christmas and is very happy with it. The parental controls are awesome and make me feel safe as a parent. Only complaint is that is doesn\\'t come with set up instructions. The voyage is light and has a battery life of Two weeks. In different light settings the Voyage automatically adjusts. My eyes do not get tired from bad lighting. Reading outside is no problem for the Voyage. We already had a tablet for our son and it was time to get one for our daughter. They are a good learning tool. This is the best...fast to play music and check weather and lots of other questions Was debating on the purchase but looked very cool ,good quality video chat is clear This is a great device when used with Ring camera and Hue lighting. Out of the box this was easy to set up and even easier to use Want a port for addition memory this model had it! Bought this tablet for 7 and 2 year old and they are very easy to use. Very durable as they have been dropped a numerous amount of times. No scratches or anything and has many apps. I prefer the Kindle to a book. I like the change of letter size, storing many, many books, and the ease of carrying it. I love to read when I travel, and this is the way to go. Now I want one. My older son wants one to. Keep of the good work. Beautiful picture. Enjoying different apps and looking forward to hours of fun. Was looking around for a good cheap tablet and this was the best one I could find especially because Best Buy was having a sale so with the Fire, a case, a stylus and a MicroSD card I only spent a little over a $100. I\\'ve been using it just about every day since I got it in December and I\\'ve not had any problems with it at all We purchased 3 of the Eco Plus and out two adult children really like their Eco Plus. They are having a lot of fun with it we are still learning This eReader is great, I have started reading more now that I have this kindle than when I read paperbacks. If you are torn on buying this for yourself or someone else I can almost guarantee anyone would love this. With enabled dictionaries and X-ray I\\'m finally able to tackle books with a heavy character list like Game of Thrones. I\\'m serious, this is so convienent and user friendly. The only negative about this device is the amount of money you will spend on new books in excitement when you first connect to Amazon with it. Gift for a relative they said they loved the gift. Bought the Amazon Fire tablet and love it. Beyond my expectations. Great value for the money. So happy I made the purchase. Bought an echo plus and it has been better than I expected. Primarily use it for music in the LR but we are starting to use it for other functions such as the weather and playing jeopardy. My kid loves it. It\\'s really convenient for us to put educational games on it for him. This speaker is truly amazing and being able to control my lights makes it even better Nice size works fine needs to weigh a little less. My son absolutely loves this tablet. He has dropped it a lot and hasn\\'t cracked it yet but even if he did amazon would replace it for up to two years for free. I also like the prime account for the kids to be able to play whatever apps for free We have greatly enjoyed using Alexa and having this gadget in our kitchen. I bought this for my daughter, wanting to get her a kindle without having access to games (like with the kindle fire). This latest version of the kindle is excellent. I am jealous of my daughter and now am thinking about upgrading from my older kindle. The touchscreen is responsive. If you like reading on the kindle, it is worth the update. It is so convenient to have a display with Alexa function. I got this mainly to watch tv/movies. Battery life is best of all devices I have used to date. I bought this as a gift and it has performed perfectly. Can\\'t beat at this price. I upgraded to have more memory and this is a great little tablet. Works great and does everything I need it to do. Amazon echo show working very well (as expected) and thanks to Amazon for adding more features on regular basis. I like the size of the device as well as the expandable storage Alexa Show is really well put together. The main reason for my purchase was to create my own \\'surveillance system\\' linking my Ring Doorbell, and Ring Floodlights to view on command by Alexa on the Show Screen. Yes, you can talk to it, and get results for almost any query, but with the show, you get a lot more. The touch screen is great for video calls, especially when you install the Alexa App on your family cell phones. Alexa can scan items via UPC and order them on Amazon, or tell you where to get them. The recipes you ask for are not only spoken to you, but SHOWN to you. Also, when music plays, you can see the lyrics on screen (If you use Amazon Music to play the music). You can ask for a news briefing, and you SEE the news, highlights, etc. The speakers aren\\'t quite up to the same standard as the echo series, but it\\'s close. The sound fills the room nicely. When the Echo Show is not being immediately used, the screen shows a picture of your choice, making it a digital frame too. Overall, the device is very nice, and they are constantly releasing new skills for Alexa to use, so it seems like there is always something new to wow you. Turning on and off lights, adjusting your thermostat, playing music, viewing security cameras are all just the standard duties, there is WAY more to do with this device! We use them for classes, they work great and are easy to use for our older individuals This was bought for a gift. But it looks nice. Just what was expected Nice sturdy case. Good way to start children on tablets. This was so easy to set up and the print can easily be adjusted to extra large. My 78 year old dad was really happy with his first experience with technology. He is now surfing the net and reading news online. Highly recommended. Product was purchased for 6 year old. Very excited to use. Had a hard time navigating initially. Battery life not as expected(too short). Short charging chord. Charging port at tablet site, easily worn. Very positional when charging when plugged in. Will stick with Apple products for now. First of all, this is not an iPad or a more expensive android tablet, but it\\'s a very good tablet for the money. I own an iPad Pro and iPad Air 2, yet this tablet has a place in my home. If you\\'re buying for kids, I wouldn\\'t buy anything more expensive than this. Good screen, fast enough, and amazon\\'s underground free apps are a huge plus. I\\'ve had this tablet for a few months now and i like it. The picture is excellent, the sound from the speakers is more than sufficient and the wifi is quick. We love our echo. Use it everyday. One thing, it claims to pick up your voice from anywhere in the room, but that\\'s not always the case. It\\'s not a big deal, just get a little closer or louder and she follows the request/answers the question. Love it! Excellent reader night or day, sunshine or shade. Not as full function as earlier kindels Nice add on to work with Arlo pro cams or if you like to sing karaoke with alexa I use it all around the house. I move it upstairs and down. With the upgrade firmware you don\\'t have to tap. Just say \"Alexa.\" Good sound, but not as good as JBL charge speaker. I bought a 2nd one as a Christmas gift. Very sleek design and very easy to use - nice graphics!!! upgraded from a previous model and cannot be happier Awesome love them had to buy 2 more for the family I purchased the 8 inch device. Also purchased black cover.I played for it and asked if I could get it set up and was told it would be 40 more dollars. I did not have 40 more dollars so I left the store with my kindle and had someone else set it up for free. I was disappointed I had to get someone else to set up my kindle. Just writing this review to get my points...This was a gift for my mother. I think she likes it fine. This is a newer version of the Fire I had previously and I love it. I like the camera. This version is lighter than the other. It is taking me a while to learn the differences but most of them are improvements. From latest news flash, to weather info, to hearing a joke while cooking and waiting for Alexa to set a timer, the Amazon Tap is a fun tool to have around the house! bigger screen than my iphone allots for easier viewing. So easy to use. I wouldn\\'t go anywhere without my kindle! Very nice tablet I like the size of it too nice for a young person Great for video calling grandparents who are not real tech savvy. They also enjoy music on demand. Got this for my daughter 2nd birthday and she absolutely love it. great for the elderly, makes life a lot easier for everyone it was good, works pretty easily. the camera is good. This kindle is awesome. I love the design of it. Nothing software wise that was different than my other kindle but the way it\\'s designed makes it much more comfortable and easier to read. The only reason I didn\\'t give it five stars was because of the price. If it were cheaper, this kindle would have been five stars no doubt. My son uses the device to help him do his homework This tablet has a lot of features, it really makes it worth the money if you have an Amazon Prime account. Love the light. It\\'s very handy to use. Have them in multiple rooms This is just the right size and can put games on it just like an iPad. Bought this for a work fundraiser and the recipient enjoyed it We put in the kitchen for the holidays and used a lot of new recipes Alexa found for us This is a awesome product. My husband and I love it. was supposed to be a gift. there was a glitch in your computer system and it told me I wouldn\\'t receive in time. ordered another one from someone else. then received it anyway. returned to store I use alexa to control my smart home and get internet information Great and easy to set up. We have this in the hallway and the whole family uses it. Alexa is learning what our family likes each day. My 8 yr old daughter uses it all the time as well. The screen is a great upgrade. Music lyrics are displayed with good quality speakers. Very convenient for recipes and you can make hands free calls with great audio quality. Great product! Great product. Exactly what I\\'ve come to expect from my Kindle readers. This tablet is not a high-tech state-of-the-art Speed Demon, but on the other hand it is more than good enough for daily use. The two biggest benefits to me are that it now comes with Alexa built in, and, you can download Amazon movies to the device to watch offline, for example on an airplane. These two features alone make it worth the very reasonable price. We already own kindles so we know they are great ! My son is going to live this! I use this while underway and it\\'s a perfect size to travel with this is a steal, have 8 gb model as well.This has more punch.. Great price! Kids love it. Lots of space for apps! Great for small children allows for limited time setting. Also allows parents to set a requirement for how long educational apps must be used before free time. Case works well This item is perfect for children and great for parents. It provides a sense of security that it will not be damaged the first week a child uses it. I wanted a new kindle fir a while. The price was right My son had one and whole family enjoys so bought one for my Daughter for Christmas I bought this primarily to be used as a Kindle eReader and this is a good product for this cost.. The only drawback is that I cannot access all the apps available on the Google PlayStore and have to be content with what is available on the Amazon app store. Have 1st gen Echo and Dot and a 2nd gen Dot. Wanted this over regular Echo, because I prefer the look and better speakers. Good for pleasure not for work. But good value for what you pay. The light came free with the Echo (didn‚Äôt know) but now that I have that one I want to get all my lights like this one! It‚Äôs so great and convenient to be able to tell it to turn off right before I leave the room instead of having to walk over there to pull the cord. Or even better when you forget to turn the switch off before you sit down, that‚Äôs the worst! It is a solid product great for kids I like it a lot love it and it only keeps getting better over time. Great product. Use it in the kitchen and can see who is at the front door with it being connected to my ring doorbell. Purchased this for my wife. All the lights are now voice activated. The sound it great from the built in speaker. loved the echo show. my only complaint is that youtube will no longer be available on it. That is one of the main reasons I purchased this as a gift. Other than that the product is great. Easy to use. I bought this tablet for my 10 year old grandson. He loves it! It is very easy to operate and has a great display. Not as fancy as the ipad, but a fraction of the cost works well with android system and all apps like on our android phones, cant beat the price I love this kindle! I had one of the first Fire HD kindles that is still kicking and awesome, but when I saw this in the store I just had to have it. I think it\\'s more user friendly and feels like it offers so many more options and functions than the Fire HD I have. Not to mention it dwarfs my last kindle in size. If I had to make one complaint, it\\'s that there is not an \"auto brightness\" function (or at least I haven\\'t found it) and you can\\'t make your pages a cream color rather than stark white. Both those options were easier on my eyes, but I am testing out the Blue Shade mode to see if that helps as much as it\\'s supposed to with night time/ bed time reading. All in all, I am extremely happy with this purchase. My son LOVES it! Easy to use and download books. Requested for his Birthday gift. Easy to set up and turn on and off restrictions. Piece of mind that daughter can\\'t access adult appropriate content I got two of these, super easy to set up. Only used them one day so far.Can\\'t fine one thing I don\\'t like about them. I originally purchased a Kindle paperwhite but returned it the next day and purchased this one. Very easy to read on, watch movies, and listen to music. A wonderful use of creativity and design, where installation was a breeze and use was pure enjoyment We bought this for our daughter, she plays with it a lot and really loves it. I will try again for the 3rd time with my new Amazon Fire. It seems to have nice upgrades. This is great. It\\'s a lot of fun and much better than I expected Went back and forth between this and the Oasis but in the end just couldn\\'t justify the added cost. So far I\\'m happy with this model. Tablet could use a better speaker otherwise a great tablet Inexpensive tablet. Funtional and great for reading. It has the blue screen that make it great for reading. I\\'m very ignorant of tablets. I bought this for my 2 year old and it has a lot to offer. The size and price makes this a best buy! I\\'m very pleased with my tablet I love the Amazon HD8! It is a great tablet for reading and surfing the web! It has a fast processor and amazing resolution. I would definitely purchase this product again. Fast working tablet but very limited on apps. I like it but it was not really for me. Only apps available were from the Amazon app store so many apps that I hoped to use were unavailable. So it is good for limited use. I‚Äôm all about the smart home and I love my new echo show. I stay more connected with my family. I also love how it‚Äôs integrated with my Arlo, Ring, Nest, and Hue light bulbs. My niece loved it! I love that it is designed especially for kids. She My daughter loves her tablet because she can carry it to all places I am not a tech person, but I was able to easily connect these devices to my network This solved the problem of my daughter\\'s lost kindle charger. Sound quality is amazing. I really like the ability to take this on the go. Downside. I wish I didn\\'t have to press the button to talk and to wake the product up Great product with cool features! Easy to install! I love the way it looks and feels. I am really enjoying my new kindle fire hd 8. The picture is awesome even for a movie. I use it mostly to read with an occasional game or movie too. Colors are great and the size of the screen is very nice. I have a 7 inch fire and there is enough size difference for movies etc to make it worthwhile. Plus there was a great black Friday price. Family is using and loving the Tap more every day. Great to find out quick information like weather, general questions and sports scores. The battery life is awesome only having to charge it every two-three days depending on usage and we use it. Excellent wifi connectivity and seamless Bluetooth connection. Use it all over the house. One of my favorite purchases. Very easy to set up. Already works with Dish hope Directv gets it soon. Wonderful little buy! Tired of my bulky tablet. This one stays charged a lot longer! If you like the Amazon Echo or the echo Dot you will love this for me the best part is when you make list or listen to music it puts the words on the screen for you Very easy to set up.Changed how I do a lot of things. My nephew is going to college next year and we want to give him a gift. Kindle suits it well for him to learn and study. Easy to use, handle and screen is perfect for a toddler. Love the Amazon Echo Show! The video display is so helpful. Very good quality video and audio sounds better than the Echo Plus speaker. Search a recipe and use it without flipping through recipe books. Need to know a measurement conversion? Just ask Alexa! Learn cooking techniques, recommended cooking times...endless list of available answers. Great addition to my kitchen. LOVE that we can play Christmas music throughout our home using all our Echo devices. Lots of fun. This works just like all echo products,,,.with smart accessories you can control your home thermostat, lights etc. Alot of expandable options. So I was given a HD for Christmas and when this went on sale in time for Father\\'s Day I had to get it... Love that it has the expansion slot!!! So I was trying this out before giving it to my son and ended up playing the games for like an hour! Some of the games are amazing quality! Just like the cartoon shows, but more interactive. We bought 2 for my twins to use on an upcoming plane ride and can\\'t wait to see their reactions! Love it! This is a great addition to the Echo family, bringing new and cool features. This kindle fire is great. The kids love it. They can watch shows and play games. Keeps them entertained. Bought this to start implementing smart home features. Gets the job done and the screen is a nice addition. We are loving it so far! Bought with a great deal and was able to use previous best buy awards to get it cheap. We also ended up buying another one for the parents for Christmas so we can chat back and forth! I love how all the echo\\'s connect now in our home. My granddaughter loves this system. It is easy for her to hold, and she loves to play games on it. Love the Alexa A.I. Better than apple and google versions. The screen gives even more points because you can see all of Alexa‚Äôs responses as well as video call. Awesome my children loving alexa always talking to alexa every day hehehe Got tablet for my daughter..love everything about it and how easy it is to use. This product is awesome. You can play your favorite music instantly. Also had great fun asking Alexa questions. Some serious some funny. We love it!! This was a life saver on our recent cross country flight. It was nice not having to worry if my three year old was too rough with it, knowing it had a great Amazon warranty. The new design, compared to my old kindle paperwhite and voyage, looked weird when I first got my Kindle Oasis. After I used it for a while (5 hours), I felt the design was kind of make sense. When I hold it with one hand (right hand), the centre of gravity position was right in my hand, so there was less change that I drop the kindle on my face(when I was laying on my bed, it happened a lot with my kindle voyage) First bought the Fire HD 8\" for myself and liked it so well that I got this one for my wife. Very easy to handle. many books to choose from and very convenient purchased this as a christmas gift for our son in law. he loved it and works well. great sound and loves the portability of the unit. I got this for my husband. He likes it and the setup is easy. After the first one stopped working after only 3 weeks-best Buy replaced it with no fuss and it\\'s going great. Small, lightweight (so fits in a purse/handbag) and with the anti-glare screen you can read in direct sunlight Love the Alexa. Very convenient to use to listen to music and turn on my lights. I purchased this as a gift for my wife and she loves it. She has an older Kindle, and she can\\'t believe how much better the Oasis is. I bought this so my kids can talk to there Grandpa and it has been Great they call him all the time Great apps, excellent price, my kids really enjoy it As a newbie in smart home technology, I was attracted to the Echo Plus because of the built-in Zigbee hub which means it can connect directly to products like the Philips Hue line of smart bulbs without the need for a separate smart hub. Combine that with the power of Alexa voice commands and I was able to get my smart home up and running in a matter of minutes. My 5 year old sons love it , Seems to be well made . Delivered on time and it looked good will hook it up next year. I have the Echo plus and i love it the speakers sounds loud and clear. I believe that this will be very useful during my husbands recovery from foot surgery. New to eBooks and researched available eReaders and tablets. What I like best about the OASIS is the weight (lightest on the market), battery life (measured in weeks not hours) and the capability to use it in bright sunlight. Recommend it for all. This was a great purchase and would definitely buy this again. The reason I didn\\'t give it 5 stars is a programmer glitch. They need to fix screen where little ones can\\'t stop or change icons while they are watching or playing games. Frustrating for two year old to stop cartoons by accidentally touching screen This tablet is great and easy to use. Great way to keep the kids entertain. It is a good tablet, but is a little slow downloading apps This is our second Show. And, one of several Christmas gifts. These are convenient and fun! Easy to set up. We use our Alexa devices as whole house intercom and for listening to music. Amazing. I seriously didn\\'t know what I was missing until I got the Amazon Show. While I have Alex Echo (and love this), having a screen that can connect to other smart home devices is amazing. I love the jokes, random questions I can ask or telling me the weather. Its essential in our house now. Hoping for an updated hdx kindle, but settled for this. Enjoy the expanded sd slot. This is an upgrade for my wife as her old kindle wouldn\\'t charge anymore. She likes the feel and the games plus reading material. It rolled over most of her games easily tried to get her to buy an iPad but she has all she needs on thus device Awesome and best e-book reader. I love the smooth page translations, bedtime shade and perfect hand held device. Kindle Fire has took their e reader to the next level. Great apps, music, and storage expansion for the price. Perfect tablet for the avid reader. Great functions light blue light filter to safeguard circadian rhythm so you do not have trouble falling asleep after being exposed to the light of a typical tablet. Easy to use and fits perfectly in hand and not too heavy for onext handed use. We bought three including one for my 2 year old. We all love it! The only complaint is the volume. There is one speaker and so the sound is obviously lower than most other tablets with two speakers. It doesn\\'t bother us too much but that\\'s why we give it 4/5 stars. Overall a great tablet. Love it. Simple setup. Ease of use. Very intuitive and fun. I purchased the Amazon - Fire Kids Edition - 7 Tablet - 16gb for my 75 year old mother after she broke her old tablet by dropping it. It took her a few hours to get used to it. Now, I cannot separate her away from it because it entertains her in so many ways and best of all she can drop the tablet and it will still work. I love this product just wish it was as smart as the Google home. Bought this for my adult son who had a long flight and he absolutely loved it! Definitely recommend! I bought 2 of these, 1 for each of my 2 youngest Grandaughters. Wanted something that would be made well, easy to use and as they get older the range of use could expand. Not only is it a good activity but a great learning tool. I will download fun and game activities but learning also even though many of the fun and game are learning tools. Their ages are 3 1/2 and 5 and they love them. Easy to download items, save to home screen or remove items. Their are several parental controls and options so you can feel worry free. Can add more than one user and profile. The first tablet I bought was good at first until it stops charging. I went to best buy to check it and they said that everything is okay. We tried it again at home and it was the same thing, it charged for a few min until probably 2% and will stop. I brought it back to the store and they replace it with a new one. So far I don\\'t have problem with it as well as the other 2 tablets that I bought together with the first tablet. This is a great device. I needed something small to read books on. This device is exactly what I was looking for. Great product. Exactly what I\\'ve come to expect from my Kindle readers. Great for kids. My grandson (5 years) is very happy with it Nice to see songs, and many other items. Shows words to music, can watch u tube. And video calls. This is a great product I would highly recommend getting it I love this product it is so easy to use It has a clear picture This tablet is perfect for my mom. She primarily uses it for playing games, the calendar and taking pictures. The camera is a decent camera for a 7\" tablet. Hopefully she\\'ll use it to read books and magazines as well. This is the third Fire tablet I have bought. The larger size is nice. Easy to use and great quality. All 3 of my kids have a Kindle Fire Bought this for my granddaughter and she loves it! I am starting my smart home and this was an addition to what we had already which was the dot and echo. This is simple to set up and the kids can even control it!! Excellent item... above and beyond my expectations So far it does what I want. Very happy with the price too. It is very enjoyable to be able to listen to the music at any time and great for parties and poolside. This is one of the best products we have every purchased. Plays any songs, give directions, weather and the sound quality is EXCELLENT! Good product for child. Who only need to read the books I picked up the show on a Black Friday deal. I probably would never have paid full price. I am glad I have the show, it is actually quite useful. The sound quality is also better than the standard echo. At the moment, my only complaints are the lack of YouTube support and the price.. It will be interesting to see what features Amazon will add to the show in the future. It\\'s a good tab for the kids, keeps them busy. Wish the speed was faster. Nice and convenient just wish that it came with written directions so that I could brighten up the screen. Perfect tablet for the avid reader. Great functions light blue light filter to safeguard circadian rhythm so you do not have trouble falling asleep after being exposed to the light of a typical tablet. Easy to use and fits perfectly in hand and not too heavy for one handed use. Alexa is great and even better with a screen to show you all your searches and videos It reads my textbooks to me while I play card games. Why did I wait so long to buy this thing? I should add that I am an Amazon Prime member so that might be needed to take full advantage of this feature. Cortonna will read all of my books to me. I didn\\'t have to upgrade my books or pay extra per book. For those that have Prime this is almost a must have. Keeps all your Amazon stuff in one place. This tablet is great for anyone who uses this for the basics.Load times can be a bit slow for browsing the web or streaming videos, but once it\\'s loaded, it plays without buffering as long as you got internet speeds that are good enough. This tablet is a good size and great for pictures, downloaded videos and music. For its price, it makes a pretty good gift for someone wanting their first tablet. Kindle Voyage is easily the best e-reader with an impressive high-resolution display and it is very thin and light weight too. Loving it. Great ebook for a beginner. Light and good looking Very good tablet for the price economical and the ability to carry in backpack Echo show has proven to be a handy gadget... useful for lots of things, like checking weather and just about any info on the web...also has great interfacing with other smart tech, like arlo cameras, ring doorbells, fire tv, etc. the more I use it the more I find it is useful, and the more I like it I bout this item for my granddaughter for Christmas. It has games that she enjoys playing The case protects the device very well. It also can be set up for age appropriate games etc. As she gets older you can change that. It is bigger than an iPod and smaller than an iPad and has a better price. Since it is a google device you can go there to get more apps Great little product for the price. Not the best camera, but it doesn\\'t claim to be. . Talk to it and see responses on the touch screen. Love it!! This is almost as good as my iPad mini. i love my apple iPad however this is a great backup. The amazon kindle fire is a great reader on a budget. It has most of the basic functions of standard tablets(Ipad, galaxy tablets) at a fraction of the cost. It also has access to a huge amazon library of books. Very nice tablet. Durable if dropped. My grand daughter loves it. I GOT THE FIRE HD SO MY KIDS COULD READ BOOKS , PLAY GAMES AND WATCH THEIR SHOWS . WITHOUT SPENDING AN ARM AND A LEG FOR THE TABLET. I THINK THIS IS A GOOD TABLE FOR KIDS / YOUNG TEENS WHO WANT TO HAVE A TABLET BUT NOT BREAK THE BANK. I enjoy the premium sound with this Amazon Echo Plus speaker. Of course it also connects to Alexa, so I can do everything from making calls to listening to music, and finding recipes for cooking meals.is compatible with smart home technology for hands-free control of lighting and other functions. I like the Amazon Echo Plus speaker because it adapts to my speech patterns. Love operation of this system.Bought the mini afterwards for another room. Purchased for my mom in a memory care center. She doesn‚Äôt have to answer the phone, we simply drop in and start talking until she sees us. Picture clarity awesome! Staff also aware of this camera feature and knows we drop in frequently. Doesn‚Äôt replace room camera but good. Would give a 5 but can‚Äôt figure out how to have other alexa owners drop in on her. Anyone know? Bought as a replacement kindle for my mother in law. She loves it perfect size for her. This product is amazing. I do however wish that there were more video features on it! It is so easy to use it is super light, and makes a book to read with no effort at all! I was a slightly skeptical about giving this to my 1 year old but it has been a fantastic, durable learning tool for him and he is progressing very quick. Love, love, love my echo plus! Is great that it has a built in bridge...great way to start a system for your smart home!Love being able to program lights to come on and off from phone... This kids fire tablet is perfect for our 5 year old granddaughter. We downloaded some free and purchase kids apps. It give us a break as she\\'s not always asking for our tablet. And we know the content on it is safe. I purchase the Echo Plus as a Christmas gift but set it up early so that it could be used right out of the box. I was impressed how easy the setup was. I\\'ll find out later how it sounds and works. Great idea for a 5 years old. very secure and good contents for that age. i bought an amazon fire 7 tablet for my 7 year old granddaughter and she loves it. it is easy to operate and charge. When they first announced the Kindle Oasis, I did not have much of a desire to upgrade from my 1st generation Kindle Paperwhite. Just as I felt when they announced the Voyage.I read a lot, so my Kindle travels with me throughout the day most of the time. I have never had an issue with battery life, I have only had it get really low a few times (typically when I was traveling). So again, I originally did not see a lot of the value to the Oasis.As the reviews for the Oasis came out, I started to realize what I did not like about my Paperwhite, and I began to have an interest in upgrading my Paperwhite to the either the Oasis or possibly the Voyage. The main thing I noticed is that I took my Paperwhite out of the Amazon case quite a lot, especially when I was in a seated position. This slight reduction in weight made it much more comfortable to hold for longer reading sessions. I had some other minor issues with my Paperwhite, like when reading in the dark, I couldn\\'t find an adjustment for the light that I preferred (5 was a little too dim and 6 was a brighter than I needed). I decided to pass on the Voyage because I really did not like the case options and the pressure sensitive page turn option.Now that I have the Oasis, I definitely think it was worth it for me. I really appreciate the reduced weight when the cover is off (not to mention the ease of removing the cover compared to the Paperwhite). It provides the same reading experience, although I did get a resolution upgrade compared to my older Paperwhite, which is a plus.The Oasis is really comfortable in my hand, which helps me forget that it is there. When I was holding my Paperwhite with my left hand, at times I would accidentally go back a page, which drove me crazy even though its just a minor inconvenience.I have the black model because it was the only option available unless I was willing to wait a few more months. The build quality of the Oasis and its case is very nice, just like with the Paperwhite and the amazon leather case for it. The only concern I have is how well it will protect the Kindle. I will update the review if I find this to be a problem.I loved my Paperwhite, and I will recommend it to anyone looking to upgrade from an older Kindle or buying one for the first time. It definitely is great and the better buy, but I am glad I decided to order the Oasis. The reduced weight, ergonomic design, and page turn buttons make it worth the added cost. May grandson loves this. Went on a long car trip and he was able to watch movies and keep entertained. Gave this to my sister-in-law for Mother\\'s Day. Its a great entry level tablet. She loves using it, especially for games. Very pleased. Based upon reviews I did expect the speaker to be louder and have a bit better sound but not a big deal. For big sound just turn on the stereo. It‚Äôs awesome being able to control the lighting and lots of other controls with this! Good tablet. Wife loves it and would recommend.... Does what it is advertise for and more. Had fun setting it up and amazed on what it can do. I even use it for security. Great little tablet for someone who is always on the go. She love it. She said it easy to use.She love it very much The Kindle is great for reading on the go when I can\\'t carry around a lot of books. I got this product for my boyfriend, and he absolutely loves it. He uses it all the time for reading. When I held it myself, I couldn\\'t believe how small and lightweight it was. Very cool It\\'s easy and intuitive. The only criticism is that it should be easier to go right into an application, instead of watching an advertisement, then having to figure out how to exit it It great to have in the home it has become invaluable Got this tablet for my spouse who has never had one before and it\\'s perfect for him! My second Kindle fire. Lives up to Amazon\\'so description Easy to use. Very lightweight. Would recommend to anyone Got this for my dad for Christmas. He likes that the speakers sound better. He also enjoys being able to make video calls with it. This is a must, excellent technology. Great design and sleek looks. I am very happy with unit. My 4 year old grandson enjoys \\'playing\\' with his tablet.. I say playing because he thinks most of the programs on it are games that he can play. At some point he will probably realize that while enjoying the games he is also learning. He enjoys it - a lot! Got this for my Daughter-in-Law and she loves it. Does exactly what she needs it to do. I love my echo show. Screen is so clear and sound is so high quality. Life amped! The features of this device have added a new dimension to our everyday routines. Pertinent and usable information by just simply asking. Superb product. Surprisingly entertaining, and a diverse selection of apps make for a fun addition to the house. Adding lights and enabled plugs adds to the fun and practicality as well. Bought for a friend with basic needs. Money was not a concern at all! love the big screen, clear pictures and fast loading. battery lasts long. I use it every day ! Great buy, do a lot of reading and he no glear screen is awesome while in the sun. My kids like it very much! The price is low. The tablet is light weighted. Tablet works well, slim design is perfect. Highly recommended to purchase this tablet. It is a very good E-Reader, battery lasts for weeks. My granddaughter loved it. She used it for her school work. It is easy to use and have a huge selection of books, I recomend it Fought it for a long time, but Kindle is awesome. The newer version with adjustable light is best for me. This is a great device, and free\\'s up my phone. Great for internet, games, radio, etc. Very nice Kindle with a great Battery life. My old kindle was not able to upgrade so I got the new Kindle and very pleased with the product. Arrived as promised from BESTBUY.COM. Nice camera. Learning how to use it, but it is easy Pretty fun little gadget. Kids love playing with it. Not even sure of all the things it can do yet Bought this gift for my wife and she loves it. Works as expected. As an existing Amazon Prime member, this is a no brainer. Has all the parental controls and kids can have a decent tablet that is durable for use, at a good price. Good size for reading and screen is easy to read. Even in sun light this was very easy to read and it fit into n small bag to carry around The Kindle Fire is small but does everything it should for a young child. Worth the low cost I paid for it. For its price, this a great little tablet. It does have limitations on what it can do and what apps are available for use with it which is the only reason I gave it 4 rather than 5 stars. Hopefully Amazon will allow it to perform better soon. I wanted to try out this technology. It is cool. Sometimes, I would prefer not to hear Alexa\\'s reply when I ask her to turn the light on. This kindle allows me to download several books. It easily fits in a purse and is light weight Battery life isn\\'t great, but overall for what I paid it is a good tablet for my kids. I did inadvertently purchase the wrong color and when I returned to the store to exchange it, the store mgr was a bit of a jerk and would not allow me to do so, despite being Elite Plus and being under 45 days. That aside it\\'s a good tablet, but I was very disappointed in the customer service issue. I\\'ve wanted a kindle for a while and decided to get it when BB put it on sale. I am not disappointed. I love my Kindle black. I can read for hours without making my eyes sore the way a phone screen would. The functions are easy to use. Everything is set up clearly and simply. It\\'s shape is adorable, and it\\'s surprisingly light. The battery does last a long time. Echo Show is a great tool in the kitchen. Paired with amazon music it makes the time go by quickly. Video selection could be better (somehow needs to strike a deal with Google for access to YouTube video). It does have nice video for recipes. I am a senior citizen who is not that great on computers or tablets, therefore, I need a book to help me understand how to do things on the tablet. I could not believe that this tablet did not come with an instruction booklet. It\\'s taking me some time but I am learning how to get around this thing. That\\'s why I can only give this product 4 stars instead of 5. My daughter loves that it is pink and she enjoys watching videos/playing on the tablet, which is what really matters. Sufficient and cheaper alternative to the more expensive tablet alternatives. Addition to my system...love talking and seeing my BFF in ATL...SUITS MY OFFICE decor. this is my third Alexa and combined with my fire TV and now the lights my couch time has increased. Love the new technology!! So we added this to our Echo family of devices. It\\'s nice to have screen, but I honestly don\\'t find I use it as much as I thought I would. The video calling feature would be pretty great IF we knew more people with a video capable Echo device.... Also, we\\'ve had some technical issues that I haven\\'t been able to resolve as of yet. Ultimately, this is a powerful little gadget and can be fun to pop on a movie while sitting at the kitchen bar counter. It\\'s also awesome to be able to display our security camera feed for the outdoor cameras, but you should probably investigate it\\'s features and your needs before splurging on this over one of the more \\'traditional\\' echo devices. It\\'s essentially an Alexa enabled tablet with a nice speaker, so something to think about. We purchased the Echo Show after using the Dot for a couple of weeks. The first thing I noticed is that the Dot‚Äôs ability to pick up your voice is by far much better than the Show. However, I think the Show‚Äôs speaker is better for listening to music.The screen on the Show is handy for looking at recipes, seeing the shopping list or watching the timer. Could you live with just the Dot? Absolutely, but there are some nice features that make the Show a handy gadget to have around. Great speaker for around the house listening to music and asking questions My son love this and it\\'s his favorite piece of technology so far. My kids read books play games take pictures they love this. Great tablet for the price, it was a Christmas present and so far so good! Very easy to use and good quality, nice picture and good size for a desk This is a very nice concept, and I think it will take on more usefulness as Alexa gains more skills. The design is a little clunky.... Google\\'s version looks nicer, but I already has Alexa devices to tie in to. I bought this for my daughter, wanting to get her a kindle without having access to games (like with the kindle fire). This latest version of the kindle is excellent. I am jealous of my daughter and now am thinking about upgrading from my older kindle. The touchscreen is responsive. If you like reading on the kindle, it is worth the update. This tablet does all I need a tablet to do. Reason why it\\'s my 3rd one. It has a great camera and I really enjoy my games and Facebook on this larger screen than my phone. I love not using my data up on my phone. It\\'s nice but not as easy to switch profiles as I would like for it being a child\\'s tablet. But overall easy to use just a lot of junk on main profile. Love to rad my books with my kindle and download straight from my device. So easy and safe. Lovit. Thanks Best Buy I bought this for my moms birthday and she loves it. Wanted something to use while charging my iPad, easy to use. Works great with WeMo and Philips Hue. Great sound and voice recognition. I wasn\\'t sure how we would like the tap, but I must say it has been fun talking to Alexa. I like asking her to tell me a joke, play my favorite radio station or play music. The fun continues as I add apps and Alexa expands her knowledge base. not a real fan of AI, but Alexa has become quite handy, entertaining, and informative. The Show itself, allows us to contact family that is in Florida and teleconference with them, in 1 simple step.Shows family photos stored in Amazon account.One word, simply AMAZING!!!Bought 1 for my parents, and they USE it!!! I enjoy taking photos with me and having enough videos to keep the kids entertained. On the fence go with the larger storage. I have used Kindle e-readers since Amazon introduced them years ago. All are good products and each new model has been a worthwhile upgrade. The Oasis is no exception, even from the highly touted Voyage model. It is expensive but the lightweight design, improved backlighting and battery cover are worth the additional expense for someone who reads frequently. This is definitely a good investment! Used it and looks very paper like. They integrated the simplest form of an e reader, which makes it stand out for its use. Bought this with the intention of reading more, it serves it\\'s purpose! I will be purchasing another one soon for my nephew, for his books and learning games. I bought this for a family member with a disability. I didn\\'t see any reviews for this purpose but so far it is working well. I felt the case would help if it was accidentally dropped. Is nice for reading, sometimes the screen is a little slow. Hate the ads on the main screen So i was looking for a bluetooth speaker for my part time job. A guy i work with at bestbuy showed me his amazon tap speaker and it was awesome! I loved u can hook it up via wifi and stream music and such. Its portable its got clean and crisp sound. It also can leave the phone i had my phone placed upstairs and i was in the basement with the speaker and it was still connected. Its very easy to use i have no complants about this speaker at all It\\'s a good tablet for kids the only thing I really don\\'t like is the fact that you need to put in a credit card to be able to get apps but other than that is ok I like this Kindle the only this is it does not read the books as good as my older Amazon Kindle Fire. We got this since we have the previous echo and love them. Easy to use and set up. Highly recommend! Great choice, battery life outstanding, many kid friendly features. My daughter love it she don\\'t really brother me it keep her so busy I am not the most tech savvy person and found this very easy to get set up without any help. love the sound of the Echo PlusIt sounds like a stero Purchased as a replacement for a Kindle and it functions well as a Kindle and a tablet. Looks nice can\\'t wait to try it out! Great price for a tablet. great for beginner or experienced person. Bought as a gift and she loves it I wasn\\'t sure I would use this item when I purchased it for my family. However, I just signed up for Amazon unlimited music after testing it on radio stations and playing games with the grandkids. I want to hook up the lighting feature as well. Speaker is excellent quality and quite enjoyable to listen to. Echo Show does everything from weather to turning on/ off my lights This is great for inquisitive minds. Alexa plays music, turns the light on, answers questions and so much more. The show works great with my other products. Love it It is a great product. It works great would definitely recommend it to anyone wanting to buy one. easy setup and we can now talk to each other and see each other very easy. great way to keep in touch without a computer. Love it. Does everything I want it to do and more. Love it, bought one for everyone in the family.. I know they‚Äôll love it too It was just what I was looking for. So far I have had no issues with it. I have really enjoyed these products so much I actually bought 3 of them. Fun to watch and even better if you are an Amazon Prime customer for music and video. I particularly like the fact that the text shows up and you can see it well outside on a sunny day. I use it with Kindle Unlimited. IT was just as described. I would recommend it to a friend. Works better than what I expected. Able to surf the net and watch movies. The battery life and screen are awesome. Bought this for under 60 bucks and looking to buy more to give as a gift Perfect..grandson, age 16 months, just loves it! No worries if dropped. Bought this for my adult son who had a long flight and he absolutely loved it! Definitely recommend! Very easy to set up. I mostly control the lights with my Hue cell phone app. Very convenient. I have 4 lamps hooked up to the light bulbs now. I plan on doing most of my house in the future. I listen to music and get weather updates from the Echo. My husband uses the echo as an alarm. Pretty cool product.Features are limited unless you spend a lot more money buying other things you can connect and interface with. But the basic unit with one lightbulb is a pretty good start. Just know going into it that you will be shelling out a lot more to expand the system. Purchased this for my mother for her birthday. She loves it. The large screen is what she wanted most. Just what she needed to keep her interested in short games & letters Great sound and voice recognition, easy to set up and fun to use. Great value, a lot of color choices. I was able to boost up the memory for just a little extra but made the apps run so much faster. Love them I also have the smaller echo and this sounds much better. Love all the features! I already have Alexa at home and since it was on sale, made a nice christmas gift.. My daughter loves her tablet. Amazon has plenty of games for her to play. It is also easy for her to use. Was a gift for our 8 year old daughter. Great for kids bought this kindle for my grandson, he loves it and it very easy to use This is a great device and so much fun to use. It is so versatile in what it can and control. Very easy basic e book reader. Good for beginners to start I am a senior citizen who is not that great on computers or tablets, therefore, I need a book to help me understand how to do things on the tablet. I could not believe that this tablet did not come with an instruction booklet. It\\'s taking me some time but I am learning how to get around this thing. That\\'s why I can only give this product 4 stars instead of 5. It is great to be able to make video calls from the kitchen. Very convenient. Was so excited to get this!!! It is so much fun to use. Gave it to my grandkids (ages 3, 4 & 9) for Christmas and they loved it. This is a pretty good all-in-one starter for a smart Home set up. It‚Äôs fully functional and doesn‚Äôt require a separate hub purchase for other smart Home devises. The show is definitely amazing, especially if you have the doorbell with video and security cameras, you can see it with echo show. I thought it would be good for my 2year old he does awesome on a iPad but could not get the hang of the kindle fire reviews were quite on spot with this product,very easy setup and very easy to use Great and informative service. The guy who helped us was very friendly. ECHO PLUS OFFERS SO MUCH MORE FOR THE SMART HOME., HOWEVER, I HAVE HAD THE DOT FOR A LONG TIME AND YESTERDAY I BOUGHT 5 ECHO DOTS FOR MY CHILDREN .GREAT PRODUCT. So much better than the original one I had. I would definitely buy another one. I got it on a pretty good sale... so I feel it was worth it. The sound is good, I like that it\\'s portable and rechargeable. I think it is best if you have a prime account so you have access to the prime music. The Echo Dot is a great personal assistant, and right now the price is fantastic. It can give you the weather forecast, traffic reports, daily news brief, play music from Pandora or other steaming radio stations, and answer questions, all in a very small package.. . The Amazon Kindle is a series of e-readers designed and marketed by Amazon. Amazon Kindle devices enable users to browse, buy, download, and read e-books, newspapers, magazines and other digital media via wireless networking to the Kindle Store. Do most of my reading on one of my Kindles. Reading in sun light to no light is great. Easier to take anywhere size wise compared to a paperback. Really great for traveling. Download several books so I have a variety to read from. Long charge life. I bought this tablet for my 4 year old grand daughter and she loves it.We set the parental controls for her age group, and now we don\\'t have to worry about what she is doing on it. We downloaded her favorite disney movies onto it, and now she has her own little private movie theater. It also works great with our Amazon Fire TV and can watch a lot of her favorite kid shows. This is a great buy for the money and I recommend it to everyone. This was purchased as a replacement for one that was dropped one to many times. Hope this one lasts as long and stands up to the abuse the first one endured. For the price you can\\'t beat this little tablet, it does an awesome job! Wife really likes it. Works great& likes the front & back camera. Great value for such a well made tablet. Everything you need for a low price I bought this tablet for my son. He damaged the previous one but it was good for his purpose. He loves to play the Minecraft app and can read a book with ease. I don\\'t have a tablet for myself. If I did, I would get the Fire. All I would really need it for would be to surf the Web and use the apps. For the price, u can\\'t go wrong. Not sure I would like this, however, words to songs..Great and ability to view my outdoor and Indoor cameras is a plus. Still learning to use. It feels a bit more rugged than my original Fire tablet, and I believe it is an excellent value. My wife loves her Fire Hd8 she had one of the older models so i up graded her to this new model and she feel in love with it right away I love that the tap is rechargeable and portable. Sounds is great! I highly recommend the tap! She has learned how to play games and learning games. Easy to get to her apps and learned how to download. She charges it every night so it can be ready for her when she gets out of school She has dropped it a few times and the case is just great Great educational tool. Not just a toy. Kids love it . Great tablet for kids. Big choice of apps, great price. The amazon fire tablet 2016 is quite good. It provides sufficient content & ability to do all of the basics one requires in a tablet. The 8 inch screen is bright and provides various settings. The tablet\\'s light weight makes it very portable. My grandkids love to use it. It has so much for them to choose and they learn too. I love my new Alexa Show. Checked prices thoroughly and Best Buy was was the ‚Äúbest‚Äù and 5 minutes away. Product is great. Easy setup and works as stated. Staff very helpful. Would recommend this product and definitely this model. :) Great product. Works well and is even easy for kids to use Great video quality, sound/music from a rather small device. Seems well made, entertaining, and more functional as we learn its many features. I love my new Kindle!! I would recommend this to everyone!! It has so many features and love the size!! So far the tablet works great. I got this for my daughter for Christmas and she downloads games no problem. The 16gb is great I\\'m glad I purchased the larger storage capacity. I am so happy to have the Echo Show. I have been able to listen to Christmas songs and some country western music. It has so many other things to do with it that I can not wait to try some. I find the picture quality amazing, the size over earlier model is welcome. Also, battery lasts many hours. For the price, it is a real bargain. I debated buying the new Kindle Oasis, since I\\'ve owned every Kindle since the first release. It was worth the money, as the form factor is the best yet... it\\'s comfortable to hold in one hand, and the text is crisp and easy to read. It\\'s great! I love the hand free whatever you want. It plays videos on Amazon by just asking it to play. At work I can video call my girlfriend at home with the show as well. Highly recommend We have one for each of my children so I bought this one for my mother. They are amazing tablets especially for the price! These Kindle Fire tablets simply can\\'t be beat in terms of value and bang for your buck if you have an Amazon Prime account it would be a crime not to have a Fire tablet.Good strong build quality, very nice bright screen with a strong picture and good resolution. They are pretty responsive, have good battery life and can handle the abuse of letting your kids use it as well. We loved the Echo Dot, but the Show is exponentially better. Especially love to see the words of the songs being played, and views of places all over the world we want to see. Big difference in cost between dot and show, but worth it! This is a great product at a great price I would definitely recommend this to anybody especially good for college students or people that read books etc. Great tablet for my kiddos they love these kindle fire kid tablets and they are very strong hold up to a lot. Price is great too. Almost feels like reading a book in a light comforting way. Easy to carry around. Great on eyes and reading is enjoyable Perfect for basic stuff, games and media. Reading, too. My children loved their previous kindles so much I bought them an upgrade with the case - so worth it. This tablet is great for kids my grandson is sick and he absolutely loves it asesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Not the fanciest tablet, but it definitely gets the job done! Bought as a gift for a friend that wanted an e-reader and he loves it! Amazing. Voice recognition great at long distances. Amazon music great! Cant say enough good! why carry a book when you can have a library at your fingertips? Get one now! The size is just right for me to carry anywhere and it\\'s simple to figure out the functions. 32 G would help me store many ireader books for a long time. I have read 3 books so far. It\\'s a perfect gift for young adult during the holiday session. Good quality little tablet, great for kids. Locked down and does not run full Android so you cannot use google play store apps. The device is a good item and I really recommend to everyone Perfect tablet for the avid reader. Great functions light blue light filter to safeguard circadian rhythm so you do not have trouble falling asleep after being exposed to the light of a typical tablet. Easy to use and fits perfectly in hand and not too heavy for one handed use. No issues perfect works as advertised........................ I bought this tablet to replace one I had (different brand) that was worn out. This is a pretty good tablet for the price. I just wanted something to use til I could get something bigger. I\\'ve had no problems with it other than some of the games I played on my other one not being available on the Fire. It\\'s a really good tablet for children good parental controls expandable up to 128 gigs I like that so it allowed me to download as many things for the children to utilize separate from the Internet all around is a good device Nice device. We use it a lot in the kitchen and the home automation. I love this product it is so easy to use It has a clear picture I recently purchased the Amazon show. It was easy to setup and use and I also added my own specialty screens and home screen. Extremely glad I bought it. I got this for my daughter, she enjoy playing this The price for this tablet is not the only great selling point. The free year of amazon free time is perfect for my son. There are tons of games, books, and videos in this service. My favorite feature is how we can set time limits on screen time. We can even set it to require an amount of learning app or book time per day before access to games is allowed. Great choice for kids. Bought this tablet to replace a 3 year old Galaxy Tab. This tablet is quick and easy to use, relatively streamlined. The screen is nice and the stereo speakers, while tiny, sound better than my old tablet. The modified Android system that Amazon is running on this tablet is good, just a bit restrictive. All in all a good tab for general browsing and popular apps.Pros:-Price-Performance-Feels sturdy-Easy to navigate-Silk browser works greatCons:-Not all apps are supported on here, like Telegram-Ads on lock screen feel unnecessary, but not a hindrance-Not as customizable as other Android tabs Excellent product very good piece strongly recommend Love the thing. My wife uses it daily. Should have bought it a long time ago. It even controls our Hue lights. Easy setup. They are adding new commands every week it seems. Still has some work till it is fully functional. We already love our other Alexa/Echo devices and this is our favorite. The drop in video chat feature is my favorite! I bought this for my almost 3 year old niece and her dad told me she loves it! It has really cute educational games on it and is pretty much indestructible with the case on it. The only reason I didn\\'t give it 5 stars is that the charger has broken already. Very easy to set up with an Amazon prime account. Haven\\'t had to pay anything, great for small kids. Like the protective cover that goes on this device Best and most affordable option of all the Kindle devices available. Just love this tablet.does everything teenage grandson needs it to do! I also buy one for my granddaughter! THIS IS AWESOME WE LOVE IT SO MUCH TALK & C PEEPS!!! I had the 4th generation. I am quite happy with the upgrade. Good battery life I love Alexa. Has a pretty good speaker for listening toMusic and helps with my shopping lists. I was looking for a tablet for my 5 year old. This tablet was definitely worth the price and it\\'s not a \"kiddie\" tablet, as she calls them. Great electronic , very easy to install me and my family enjoy the things that Alexa do very satisfied with my service that I received from Best Buy when I purchase it looking forward to shopping there more often and I\\'m a new customer there Great sharp pictures and easy navigation. Enjoy the different background option for my books. Seems to be great but just need a little more time to play with it. The main user is nearly four years old. Happy with it and gets excited when using it. I like the way I can read many books and magazines as well as play various games on my kindle. Bought this for my 3 kids aged 9,7,and 2. They all use it with ease. They each have their own account with appropriate games. We like the protective cover that absorbs drops and falls well. BOUGHT FOR MY GRANDKIDS AGES 5-10 AND THEY LOVED IT Too many great things to say about the echo show! I have had an echo dot for a while but the new echo who adds video. I literally use it everyday multiple times a day. Great product Amazon! I have two kids and they both love it. Its also nice because it is already setup for them. convenient, easy to use and grand kids all have one too. Love our Echo show. A few enhancements we‚Äôd like to see in future such as ability to load multiple pictures instead of single photo. Can use Amazon photo but we do not prescribe. Bought this for my son,, the size is perfect not too small not too big. Kid friendly..and easy to use. Overall o rate it 5 stars..no problems to list Great that you can get these in different colors to differentiate from the other one! Great Fire tablet! Speedy service and experience! Bravo! I got this tablet for Skype calls and browsing. It\\'s good if you don\\'t have an ample scope of tasks I\\'m very happy with my purchase. I bought one because my wife has one and is very happy with hers. Facilitates easy home set-up of many Smart devices. I replaced my kindle that I had for 4 years with the new one and after a short time was able to access all my books and continue reading the book that I was reading before I bought the new kindle. I am pleased with the new touch screen for moving to the next page, like that this one is smaller and easier to take in my purse. I did purchase a case and it is protective and durable. I will enjoy this kindle for years to come An amazing electronic tool, so portable, great storage, books, great convenience. Love this base for charging my kindle. You still need to use a good cord for most effective charge. With a good cord and this base your kindle will charge in under 30 minutes. I the awesome I use it at work at lot its loud enough to enjoy any where Loud speaker, very responsive. Makes it easier that the smart hub is built into it than having to buy another piece of equipment. This is our first Echo so nothing to compare it to, but so far so good! Sound is great. Fun to use and has been helpful for information needed quickly! I bought this kindle for the extra size. I have recently been having trouble with seeing clearly so I figured with the size it may be easier. It was and I really like being able to change the color of the fonts and background, it seems to help immensely. Couldn\\'t recommend this more for kids. Price and features are awesome along with parental controls. I love the internet, tweeting and facebook. No computers can complete me!! My kindle takes care of all my needs ;) !!!Juju I had a Kindle Fire and upgraded to the 5th generation. Could not be more pleased with this tablet. The Amazon Kids Fire keeps my grandson captivated with lots of activities. He loves that it\\'s just right for his little hands. He makes sure that everyone in the family knows the Kindle belongs to him by saying, \"It\\'s mine!\" Got this for Christmas for my 3 year old and she loves it! Great camera for a beginner very easy to understand I was a ook user and have been converted to kindle. The size is great and it is very responsive. Got one for me and one as a gift. Solid Amazon Echo, love they have added Phillips Hub into the product so you do not need a hub. Voice response is a little touchy compared to other Echos. I purchase one for my children and us is a great way to stay connected and smart to have it at home The sales people are really nice and knowledgeable to me I will come back again I love my Echo Plus!! The hub makes it easy to add devices to my Smarthome and Alexa is a great addition!! Purchased this as a gift for my wife because her B&N Nook was dying. She absolutely loves it, especially since it does so much more. I\\'m now waiting for my Nook to start acting up so that I have an excuse to get a Kindle for myself. So far I love the echo products. I ended up buying a combination of 8 for Christmas gifts I bought this device for my wife and she loves it. Plays videos for cooking. 1 on gift list. For sure. I love this tablet! It\\'s the perfect size. I can do everything on it and it was affordable! 9.5/10 Rating ! This has to be one of the best AI products I have used in a while. The screen for an smart home device can be very useful. It really can\\'t compete with the Google home because the Show just brings convenience without having to call it. I primarily use the show to turn on/off my smart lights, simple cooking measurements, simple math, travel time, store location hours, calling, and video calling.... and more. Everything else like, news, calendars, weather are already displayed on screen. Definitely worth it if you plan on using all the minimum features above. It a great tablet for children. But it doesnt work with google apps. This is actually a pretty good little tablet. It is not the most powerful and it doesn\\'t have the highest resolution screen. But for the price, you can\\'t go wrong. It does what it is supposed to do and for the low price you won\\'t feel much pain if you break it. A perfect first tablet for the kids or a nice secondary tablet that you can just toss in a bag or the car for road trips. My granddaughter like\\'s her tablet, she has learning a lot.the case is durable and I was glad that the case came in pink. Well made and profrssional looking. Operating manual clear and complete. Next generation of Kindle - with more storage. Allows the kids to download and play the favorite games I originally got the lower end Kindle, took it back and upgraded. The light really is a must. I can\\'t believe how much more I\\'m reading now that I have it, and there are TONS of free books out there if you know where to look. Best. Purchase. EVER. It made a great Christmas present for my wife. Plus...I get it too...Works great. Great order and delivery from Best Buy. I thought long and hard about upgrading from my paperwhite, but decided to do so despite not beating able to actually see one in the store. I have owned a Kindle since the second generation version. This is by far my favorite. The look and feel are amazing. I don\\'t regret the purchase one bit as I have the disposable income to do so, but for most the paperwhite will more than suffice at a significantly smaller price point. nice item, and cute. the tablet is difficult to navigate This is a neat little toy. It‚Äôs pretty cool that I‚Äôm able to turn the lights on and off, by talking to Alexa. I love that you and now see your answer on a screen with the Alexa Echo Show!!! I purchased two of these tablet a pink and blue. They was for my 5 and 7 years children. They really love their tablets. Yes, it was a birthday gift. The unit does a good job of playing music from Amazon music. It hears your voice very good although it gets confused at times when I tell it to turn on a particular lamp and I have to slowly pronunciate it. Like that the music shows the lyrics. Do need a family account on Amazon music to plan different music on different units in different rooms at the same time though. I have one Alexa and three Echo dots and having Echo Show now is awesome! At first I was concerned with the funny looking angle I saw on the pictures. The item was not displayed at the local store so I decided to take a chance. As an owner of the Echo Dot i figured it would work in the same manner and it does. I love that it works with the Arlo Pro. The screen is great and I soon figured out the reason for the funny angle of the item. The angled screen works great Only setback or recommendation would be to add a auxiliary output at the rear. Also you can watch prime movies, YouTube videos etc. I bought this for my grandson and he loves it. great It\\'s beyond my expectation, and it can even show music score. Not fast turning though. Bought this for my mom that is electronically challenged and she loves it. Makes her feel like she is a tech wiz. Makes me feel better about her ability to turn lights on and off as she comes and goes. More importantly, she is in her 70s and Iives alone, she can make a phone call using Alexa from anywhere she has an echo. I bought her 3 to cover her whole house. This means if she falls down and can‚Äôt get to her phone she can dial me or 911 with her voice.....a must have!!! My granddaughter loved it. She used it for her school work. received as a Christmas gift. really works well, we can turn the living room light on and off from anywhere with cell phone, so you don\\'t need to remember to plug in a timer when going away. plays amazon music and sound is amazing I bought this tablet to replace one I had bought a while ago for my daughter, all I heard upon opening is \"Mom, you are the best\", as she was excited to get a newer up to date Fire. She loves the fire tablet and so do we as a family. Amazon Fire is our go to. We can not switch to anything else! It is a great product. It works great would definitely recommend it to anyone wanting to buy one. This is my first e reader. I did ttry my friends papperwhite but voyage is the best of the e reader world. The screen is awesome. I read a lot at night before I sleep and I use to read in my mobile which after sometime feels like my eyes are burning. But with voyage I can read as much time I want. No strain no burning sensation in my eyes. Compared to the papperwhite the screen looks better. Feels like I am actually reading a paper book. I have grown very accustomed to having Alexa around. There are new skills added on a very regular basis. I really enjoy just pressing a button and asking for a song/radio station/podcast to be played. I also enjoy having books read to me, since I\\'m not much of a reader. The setup was super simple, so simple that I wasn\\'t sure that I was all ready to go with such minimal effort. The battery life is very long and the speaker suits me just fine. I feel that there is a bright future for the Tap and I am going to enjoy trying more things that this gadget has to offer. I\\'m not sure I \"needed\" this item, but I can\\'t imagine not having it around now. So pleased with this purchase. Hard to use, No way to delete things from screen. Need better manual. most books are impossible if they are reference books. Added another echo to the family. This one came with a free Philips HUE bulb on black friday which was great You can\\'t beat the price. Great deal for what you\\'re paying. Such an easy set up. My family and I use it for so many things. Wake up in the morning, the morning commute traffic report. Recipes, facts, phone calls and of course music! Since I got it and have had friends and family over, they have gone out to buy it as well. Excellent purchase. Well worth the money! Purchase was to replace Fire HD 8.9 that was left on a plane (found & return 50 days later). Like this smaller version due to size & it\\'s 3 years newer on the technology side. It works nice. Still seems like ancient techonology compared to any apple product It‚Äôs good, but not google smart, it answers when no one asks. Kind of spooky. The distinction in the voice context is absent Bought this for my 9 year old Godson and he loves it. He would play it for hours on end if his parents would let him. He mostly plays games on it but he also uses it to watch videos and read books. My daughter loves this tablet! She plays multiple games and has taken video. Easy to use and the color is very vivid! My granddaughter loves her tablet toddler friendly I love this product! The possibilities are endless! Amazon keeps getting better. Tablet now has option to move icons, set wallpaper and more. With added SD card option, is even better. Great device. Love Alexa being able to pull up home cameras to view!! Love every aspect of the Echo. We even went and bought a Tap! Addition to my system...love talking and seeing my BFF in ATL...SUITS MY OFFICE decor. It is awesome play pokemon and clash use silk its awesome great present The Tap is a great portable speaker with fantastic sound. If you press a button then you can connect to Amazon Alexa and she can play your music, answer questions, etc. Downgraded one star because there is supposed to be a hands free option for Alexa but I haven\\'t been able to get it to work. Still great to be able to take this around the house vs Echo which is tied to the plug. Easy to use! Just plug in and search for your favorite movies and TV shows. Looking for a reader with some basic tablet functions. This was just that. My 2 yr old loves his tablet. Best purchase ever. It has great educational videos and is easy for him to work on his kids profile. Amazon got it right! Small & without audio but easy to use. Able to connect to Amazon account & Goodreads account easily. The only thing I hate is that I have to keep restarting it if I want to get out of a ebook that I‚Äôm currently reading My son loves it. Light weight. Good price for a great product. I would purchase another one. Does everything we wanted. Great value for the price. Great product. Highly recommended. Great value and great price Very easy to use and has so much to offer for the low price. The product is very durable and is great for children Great product as usually ... better screen and faster than my previous. Work with my chromecast .. easy to use Will work well for the purpose it was purchased. My child will love the fun and games that he can play. Very child appropriate and user friendly. I would encourage any parent to buy this product. Excellent product,my children love this item. Thanks I already had the 1st gen Echo. This one has considerably more options that I can use. I highly recommend this item. Bought this for my mom who is in her 70\\'s. It\\'s perfect and easy to use for the older generation. I purchased this tablet for my grandmother to use. She loves it. It is easy to navigate for her. The only thing that annoys her is when the apps need to be updated. She does not have internet at home so she has to wait to update her apps when she visits family (who has internet service). Got this to replace my iPhone that my daughter constantly has to have to watch her Elmo videos. This is a durable perfect solution. She understands most of the apps and can navigate to watch whatever she wants. This comes with a warranty that if she does anything to break it, it will be replaced for free. That was the final selling point I needed! I can read just about any book that is published and not leave my house to go to the store and have to buy them. This is great for kids, my 3yr old uses and it has fallen and the cover really protects it. The kids section is filled with lots of apps very easy to use I live my fire the best purchase I have made in months very good product and service will refer a friend. I only purchased this because I loved the sound quality. Alexa is just a added bonus personally as I rarely hit the \"tap\" button to ask her anything. The few times I asked her questions, she hasn\\'t disappointed. EXTRA: Now what would make this device amazing is if Alexa was able to connect to my Apple Music playlist! If only... bought these for family members out of state for Christmas, finding it is way more than expected. Can talk face to face with them, make shopping lists, listen to stories, play interactive trivia music games, is there no end to possibilities? They all LOVED their gift (thank you Best Buy for great sale to make affordable)... This tablet is designed primarily to sell, distribute and store media purchased from the Amazon.com product line, ie Kindle e-books, movies viewed or stored from their online movie streaming service, etc., and it does that very well.Reasonably sharp screen, good sound, good battery life and decent component materials. It uses their version of the Android OS which they call the Fire OS which is decently responsive and fairly intuitive to use - Be aware that you cannot install or run most apps purchased from the Google Play store, but must rely on Amazon\\'s own app store which is decent, but not as extensive as either Apple\\'s or Google\\'s. My son loves his tablet or at least that\\'s what he calls it $150 is a good price for this Alexa with a screen. I had a very early generation Kindle that I loved. I was unwilling to update my Kindle because it was so great. The new one I got from my wife made it look like the old one was standing still. It\\'s much faster and I love it. Bought one of these two weeks before on Amazon and paid almost double for what Best Buy had these for. So, i bought another one the same day as this! Great product and service and the sales man r really nice. Worked right out of the box easy set up and operation I bought this for my mom on her birthday. She loves it. It big enough and easy for her to navigate. I Love this tablet its Awesome and way Cool I highly recommend this to anyone Great price Great for all your tablet needs! Email, video, games, and reading! All in one!! I couldn\\'t decide on which one to buy. They all do the same things, but ended up buying the tap which is portable. I take it on my deck with a cup of coffee and listen to the music I put in through pandora and iheart radio. I absolutely love it, and so does my husband. I seen one that my son-in-law had and enjoyed using it. My daughter like the tablet and she use the tabet everday I have bought the cheaper tablets for my kids, in the past, however, the sales associate recommend this tablet, and it was only 10 dollars more. So far, I am really impressed by the difference in quality. Great tablet, so affordable and an awesome service! As I made my home a smart home I know I know I made a smart choice with Amazon Echo and Philips light bulbs. I\\'m looking forward to adding more smart gadgets to my collection. The best kindle that I ever had!It is great if you love reading and really want to have the feel of handling a book.Great for indoor and outdoor reading Love the knowledge it gives, and easy for my older brother who does. It so technology. My son loves it. Easy set up. And the best part is the case. It really is childproof. My son has dropped it and nothing had happened. Very durable. Just what my son needed. LOVE it. Never had one before. Easy to set up and use. This e-reader meets all expectations and has a good feel to it. It ended up being the most popular gift that she got it does a wonderful job for children I gave as a gift to a kid who has autism! It has been helping on his development a lot! Got this for my grandson 7 yrs old - perfect size. As advertised. Easy set up and integration. Haven\\'t tried to use the hub yet but it is limited in the number of products it works with compared to Samsung Smartthing or Wink 2. Great for reading books, but I having to manually update the apps is a pain. bought for husband and he was surprised it does the work he needs it for The connectivity was okay to setup for access the navigation was a little clumsy. Overall good product for a good price in it\\'s category. My son uses this tablet for movies and music and to surf the internet. For the money it has been fantastic. First time user of the Alexa plus. Using it more and more every day. Love it This is my third echo, and the video screen is a nice addition. I\\'d like to give it 4.5 stars, but not an option. The only thing that\\'s is not as good as my previous ones is that I feel the microphone does not understand me as well. Also, at this point the screen has a lot of potential but not much is implemented yet. (e.g. watch cable tv over internet). it works great it is handy to use to look stuff up fast and has some great features.i added a memory card to add movies and it works great for that at a great price I had the Echo previously, but having the screen opens up more options for Alexa. I find it helpful to be able to glance at the screen and see things like time and weather. I also have cameras setup and I can use Alexa to view these feeds. While the unit is kind of large, it is stable and supports touch. I haven\\'t tried video calling or playing videos, but the screen quality seems pretty good. Great product. Works as advertised and fun to use. I got this for my sister who is in Paris and she doesn\\'t go anywhere without it. All the benefits of a real book and none of the cons. This is a great device that actually has a lot of usefulness to it. After about a week you\\'re going to be wondering what else can I do? what else can this help you with? So my suggestion is to get one of these as a start. Then prioritize the purchase of an echo (not plus) and a spot. Great price, large selection. Plenty to choose from! Solid entry level Kindle. Great for kids. Gifted for a kid of my friend and they love to use it to read more than their iPads. battery is good but higher model is a bit better. Love it will recommend it to my friends.Found it to be as good as having a I pad.You can take good photos and face time as well as text.A vary llite tablet that comes in a number of colors.You can also use it out doors because it has a polarizing filter. Exactly what I expected. I own three of these already. You will not find another tablet like this with the affordable price. Nice size, nice look,love the feel of turning the page. Great reading experience. bought this as a christmas gift for our son, it holds a lot of games and is very easy to use Got it for my kid after loosing the last one way better and faster. I think it is worth the sale price of $150.00 but it has limitations. For example it shows my calendar but you can only see the first item, then if you ask for more, you see the next 3 or so. I The screen is updating with trivia...some interesting some not so much. I bet the next generation is a lot better We got this for a young girl who is 9. She loves it and there a lot of Apps that she likes. There are parental controls which is a plus, recommend for almost any age group. I bought this low-priced Kindle to test as a travel replacement for my 14-pounds of laptop. I wound up taking it on a month-long trip out of the country, and it was superb for email, online transactions like buying theatre tix, and finding and making various reservations. Also, outstanding performance for videos and music. All this for $70. Suggest you buy a USB-mini cable if you buy one of these superb devices. yokod Tried different charging blocks, nothing worked properly. Plugged in the Amazon block, Kindle came right up. Got for my aunt for her first tablet. It has been user friendly for her, she yours it mostly for reading This make an excellent ebook reader. Don\\'t expect much from this device except to read basic ebooks. The good thing is it\\'s cheap and good to read in the sun. We bought two of these for the kids. They love them and I now have an echo dot I gave as a gift to my kids for Christmas, they are enjoying Alexa. I love this. Has great sound. I thought i bought in silver. THe packaging was a little deceptive. But I\\'m loving it. Wanting to get a second one. My niece loves this tablet! She will not put it down! Easy to set up. Performs well. Nice Product For The Money We got this for our nephew and he absolutely loves it, very easy for him to use too. Love the access to films. Easy to read and work with. A Little like an Android. I am used to IPhone apps but this works great once you understand it. This has the all speed and storage I needed for my preschooler. The case is soft and light and I can tell it will protect the tablet really well. I really like the ease of getting to the kid-friendly apps and videos. Has easy to set up parental controls. I love our Amazon echo plus! My boyfriend says this was the best present for Christmas. daily. Device must be studied and practiced with to gain max use of its robust capacity . This tablet is easy to use and great for a new user. I have an Alexa but wanted a speaker for traveling. You can use this without a plug in cord. I love it! I\\'m a senior and was able to set it up and get library books without help. I like that the tablet has child settings and time usage. Very helpful in setting time limits. This is a grate product and the price very fare just so happy with my Kindle! We bought it for our granddaughter and she absolutely loved it! Daughter uses it constantly for games, texting, Web surfing, and email. Great alternative to more expensive devices. My daughter loves her tablet I love free time love the case it came with just right to buy for a kids first tablet Great device very functional love it will recommend I hope that Azi will like to have her own entertainment instead of playing games on the cell phone. I was very pleased with how easy it is for children to maneuver. I was skeptical about the Amazon Echo products. Why would I need this? I bought the Echo Dot first and was hooked. Bought this Echo Plus for smart home integration. Since then, I have bought a bunch of smart bulbs and plan on more \"things\", I bought an Echo Spot, too. You do not need an Echo product, but they are fun, practical and cool. Can\\'t live without it now! Bought these for my grand children for Christmas and they have thoroughly enjoyed using their \\'tablets\\' and the apps that can easily be saved on the tablet. This product was purchased for my Grandson. He had a fire 6. He however loves the HD 8. He uses it for music & gaming mostly. Great electronic device. The amazon fire tablet is awesome..my kids love it Not an iPad, but that\\'s not what I wanted. High quality, does everything I need it to do. Love the sound, I have a google home and is not as loud as this echo This was bought for a gift. But it looks nice. Just what was expected I love my amazon echo plus as bad as it sounds I don‚Äôt have to get out of bed to turn the lights off, my fans on or off, and even my tv. We love alexa! I go this tablet after problems with 2 Samsung tablets. so far like it. all apps I use available. A little slower than previous tablets that is the only reason for the 4 stars Kindle products are easy to use and set up. It does most everything the expensive tablets do. The UI experience is great, especially for Prime members. The tablet is quick and responsive with plenty of memory to ha for any task. Gave it to my grandkids(ages 3, 4 & 9) for Christmas and they loved it. Love the bigger screen but do think this Fire HD 10TH runs a little slow. My last Fire HD was not as slow. This is the best tablet I\\'ve ever purchased. The screen is amazing and very functional and the kid mode is easy to get to and my 5 year old loves it makes me jealous and want to get a kindle but that\\'s ok I can use parent most while he\\'s sleeping. All over a really good tablet for both parent and child Only problem is that it is impossible to read or do anything on the KindleFire with any light in the room at all; far worse than impossible in sunlight. There should be some sort of temporary screen or other add-on that can be used with the device when in sunny or bright locations. The Amazon HD 8 is by far the best budget tablet. If you just need a tablet to browse the web and watch videos this tablet is the way to go! That being said, it is fairly slow but who cares if you do not use the tablet for photo/video editing, gaming, picture taking, etc... This is the second one I bought. My grandkids love them. Good one and working without any issues. Slim and portable Great to talk and see family at anytime. Easy to use Very pleased to have this new Echo Plus and get started on automation of the home in stages. Knowing that it can continue to improve with new products and apps is a plus for owning this device. Good inexpensive device. Still in touch with modern technology. Love it. It‚Äôs a lot of fun. Great speakers too provides a lot of great information and fun too! This speaker has great sound and is very easy to use. Great price and works great for book reading. Would recommend Echo Show is a great addition to any home and we were thrilled to buy one for each of our children\\'s families during this holiday season! I bought this item for my 9 year old son. He loves it and it has nice feaures such as parental controls. If you love Amazon, you\\'ll love the Kindle HD8. It\\'s a great size for reading all those books, streaming movies and tv shows, and has great sound for listening to your favorite music. For less than $100, you can\\'t beat the versatility of this little device! I bought this because I recently signed up for Amazon Prime and wanted to take advantage of the free books. Nice tablet. I was looking to upgrade from my old Kindle reader and stumbled on the Fire HD which is not only a reader but a tablet as well. Fairly easy to use. I really only needed to read books but how have a tablet as well. I wish it supported all google play apps and not just Amazon apps but I can check email and get to the web so it serves the purpose. But...when I want to read in the middle of the night, getting to the web can be distracting. A good product that provides the services I desire. I bought this to replace a damaged much more expensive tablet of my daughters. Great item and just as nice as the more expensive one. She absolutely loves it. The battery doesn\\'t last as long as was advertised, if you have the money I would recommend the backlit model. Bought this for someone as a gift. They are big on amazon kindle so this was a huge plus with other features and amazon store improving. They love it.I know other tablets have kindle apps but this was an awesome price. This was replacement for my wife\\'s original iPad and broken Kindle Paperwhite. She loves it, as it does basically everything both of the previous devices did in one unit that is easy to use, has good battery life, very nice screen resolution and good size for her. Great value, especially compared to an iPad. This tablet is great for kids my grandson is sick and he absolutely loves it Got it as a gift for my grandma and she loves it!! I own a dot and a first gen echo and the sound from the show is way better than both of my other echoes. The video functions are nice but it is a pain to get it to play videos from my Amazon library. My family enjoys the calendar info and the news briefings that rotate on the screen. Perfect for reading but also has many other functions. Downloaded my favorite games & travel apps. Set up easy. So far, works great. Got two for my mom\\'s and they love it. So many great features!!! Staff was very helpful and polite ! Went in asked for help and was pointed in the right direction! I like the tablet; however, there are occasions when it does not boot up when it is turned on. I probably need to take it into the store so that a determination can be made and it can be fixed. The images are crisp and text very easy to read. Apps are good and easy to navigate. Love it. This is just the perfect item for what we needed. It is compact and can go anywhere with you. The Echo show with video screen is a nice upgrade to the other echo‚Äôs. News briefs with videos are nice. Very good sound quality for playing music. My kids love this product it keeps them busy anytime of day I love this solutions for my kids. I gave it a four star rating because in order to install Apps you just have to tap the icon. Well my Two year old and five year old went tap crazy, like a Kangaroo on a Pogo stick. Needless to say the ran out of room quickly. I tried to teach them to not launch apps that weren\\'t installed but they still have a problem discerning what is installed and what isn\\'t. Aside from this, it is a fantastic device for kids to play and learn with. I especially like the parental control features. I just wish they would put in a feature for controlling what gets installed. I hope to find all my books in the electronic format. This is my 5th Amazon Alexa product. I used to have the Alexa Echo, but moved that up to my bedroom. Now I use the Echo Show downstairs and has good sound quality. I also like that I can add my Home Security system to operate through it and can see all my cameras. Great product. My daughter loves her tablet because she can carry it to all places This is my second Kindle. The first was a gift several years ago. The display and speed are much better. My daughter is totally enjoying her tablet.Recently though, it is not charging correctly. I will come to store to have it looked at. I purchased this tablet for my granddaughter and she just loves it...so much I have to take on the week days ... A lazy mans drean when it is combined with Alexa. If you get the harmony hub you can really impress with home automation I bought the fire because I had heard it was a good tablet. So when I bought it, I was wondering if it lived up to the hype. It does. Its fast and easy to use. I put Netflix on it and watch series I missed. Only downside is that I had to register for a trial of prime. Nice tablet at a very affordable price............. Very happy with my purchase. The tablet works amazingly good for the price. grandson really enjoyed it Christmas. very easy to use She\\'s becoming part of the family, but, the Echo Plus is not much different (that I have discovered, yet, anyway) than the Echo 2nd generation. I haven\\'t had the Echo 1st generation and so I do not know. I have had the Echos (Plus, Echos-2nd generation, and Dot) about 3 weeks and the only thing I think makes the difference is that it has a better sound quality, but, we are talking for those really connoisseur kinds of ears or the ones that like to turn up the volume. The Hue lightbulbs are great. I bought the Echo Plus on a Black Friday extended Sale and the Hue lightbulb was a real bonus, further. I liked it so much I went back and bought the pack of Hue bulbs that were also on sale. We are loving the whole system and the lightbulbs. Purchased this as a gift for my father and he\\'s loving it. My son uses his tablet on a daily basis. He makes sure he has his case on it and can use all the apps. I can also use it and put on parental protections. I purchased this on Black Friday because I could pass on the price. The tablet works great for basic internet needs and great for shopping on Amazon. If I were to purchase another Android Tablet, I will look for something with a little more power since this tablet slows when multi-tasking. The Echo Show is a very awesome product because of Alexa itself! She will answer questions you ask her, play music on your demand, and you can even ask her to make calls and video chats for you. I also like the fact that it sounds very nice and the video quality is unlike anything I\\'ve ever seen in a hybrid tablet product. A must have for your home! Great e-reader. Easy to download books. Screen is easy to read from. Purchased the Echo Plus and couldn\\'t be more pleased. Easy to use. Bought for my mom as a gift. She\\'s not tech savvy but it\\'s easy for her to get used to. Definitely a good tablet for beginners. works great for my 2 year old. I don\\'t like that it requires a pin to use it but goodidn\\'t and strong tablet Decent camera, clarity on the screen, fast downloads. The kindle has come in very handy lately, I always have a book to read and this is great to just grab on the go. Battery life is great, only drawback is no backlight. Easy to play and very helpful to learning for children\\'s I love the touch screen aspect still love the original. I bought this as a gift. As far as know it works fine Decided to go for the model just below this one. I didn\\'t need the integrated \"hub\" features. (Phillips Hue does require this, but I decided to stick with my current Insteon hub). I had originally bought my son the Kindle Fire HDX. And it worked great for him. The only downfall to it was he wanted both the rear and front facing cameras. But it only came with the front facing camera. As children do they break things. And he broke the screen on this one after having it for a year. I did not want to spend that much money on the second kindle so that\\'s why I chose this Amazon Fire 7-inch tablet. And it has the front and rear facing cameras and that my son wanted. All the features are the same. It is a great buy. I would highly recommend it. I reviewed a lot of tablets before I bought this one. It is the first one I have ever purchased. I am no tech geek and it was pretty easy to figure out how to use it. I mostly bought it for and use it for: reading e-mail, facebook, and browsing the internet. I really like it and use it more than my laptop. But, if I need to do anything detailed, I use my laptop. Overall it\\'s a great tablet for a beginner, and you can\\'t beat the price. The tablet is Excellent! Very fast and well worth the money! The display is great! I LOVE Alexa and my Echo device (and Smart Bulb) so much I bought 4 more Echos and 8 more bulbs with more to come soon... I love being able to turn my lights on or off by voice. It makes life a lot easier. I am looking forward to finish making my home a smart home by buying other products. Really enjoy the Echo Plus, this is a must have for all homes! When I first read about Amazon Echo Show, I thought the sound quality would be inferior to Echo because of the small size, which to me would be a deal breaker. I read that the sound is actually superior to Echo & it is compatible with most existing security cameras, so I decided to buy one. Then Best Buy ran a strong promotion if you buy 2, so I caved and bought 2. (I have a number of Echo\\'s and 2) Echo Dots in the house). I am completely BLOWN AWAY by Echo Show!! Here is a brief summary of thoughts: LIKES: 1- Substantially the Best Sound Quality of any Echo to date, with stronger bass, directional stereo, Dolby Audio & focused sound field to the front. You can rock out louder, with less sound to the sides & back, so you do not share your music to all, as does the Echo.2- The 8) Far Field microphones are more effective than Echo. 3- High resolution 7\" screen is perfect for a desk or kitchen. 4- Song lyrics are great! (Free optional setting to turn on lyrics). 5- Photos of the album cover & the band on all music are awesome! 6- 3) buttons on top: Mute / Camera Defeat with red on screen indicator; Volume UP & Volume Down. 7- Excellent resolution with built-in camera. 8- Auto presence detector turns Show screen on when you are detected. 9- Speak to Alexa, just as with Echo or Dot, & Show mutes the volume & shows what you asked on the screen, with the music volume lowered in the background. 10- Ask the forecast & you get written & verbal forecast. You also get a second screen showing the next 4 days, including real feel, a picture of the anticipated weather, chance of rain, etc. 11- Say: Alexa, show me the \"Front Porch\", or any of the numerous security cameras & within 2 seconds, there is a highly detailed live video with sound! 12- Video conference - I do not know anyone else with Show yet, so I cannot try this but call yourself & you can see the picture they will see to adjust your surroundings. 13- Uses the same power supply as Amazon Echo. 14- Sleek shape fits right in with contemporary surroundings (see photo of Show in the center of the desk with 2) 4K monitors & iPad Pro). 15- The touch screen sensitivity is perfect. 16- Build quality is First Rate! 17- Rubber feet protect any surface & are anti - slip. 18- Addictive! More than any other device, this is one you will want in the center of your desk, as shown in my photo, because once you add the video component, you will wonder how you enjoyed music, sports, & just about everything, without it! 19- See your shopping list. 20- See visual confirmation that the lights you ask Alexa to turn on actually turned on. DISLIKES: NONE! I would only offer one design option. I would offer an optional Amazon Echo Show Wireless Subwoofer for this beast, that you could buy later. It would work like the many Soundbars that include a Wireless Sub. That would allow SHOW to not only ROCK OUT, but to shake the walls at the same time!I am seriously planning to sell some Echos & Dots to pick up a couple more Shows. They are GREAT!! It works fast and very clear, speakers sound amazing, looks great in bedroom. Enjoying using Alexa.... and love the smart home features. We loved the Echo Dot, but the Show is exponentially better. Especially love to see the words of the songs being played, and views of places all over the world we want to see. Big difference in cost between dot and show, but worth it! Great generic tablet for looking to keep kids occupied. Mine enjoy the FreeTime Unlimited, and the child restrictions are great for my needs.My only concern has been for the space available. I was amazed at how quickly they ate up 32 GB of space on apps. What a treat! What‚Äôs the weather forecast? What‚Äôs the news this morning?? Just about all you need to know - plus Smart home control!! My DIL loves it. Does everything she had read about. My grandson is a bit disappointed that Alexa can\\'t carry on a conversation. LOL. However, he is only 8. Excellent product for what it does. Spouse loves it!Nough said! I love this tablet/kindle. I can access email, Facebook, play simple games, shop online and read my books. Love playing music and talking to Alexa and looking at my camera three the screen my daughter just loved this kindle fire. she said it was the perfect gift that she could receive. This was a replacement for another kindle. They are very durable and do everything I need them to do. This tablet is a nice budget friendly device that is also rugged. It has survived countless falls from my 3 yr old. He loves it and it keeps him learning for hours. The video screen really adds wonderfully to the functionality of the echo devices. Thoughts of being able to have the Echo \"grow\" as I added to the list of tasks, excited me. Including the latest app, having it to recognize my smartphone\\'s contact list to place and to receive calls. However, the Echo I purchased does not link up to my Samsung smartphone. Disappointed is a understatement. I bought it for my niece who is 7 seven years old. She loves it and she learns from the applications included. Great for kids. Simple and inexpensive. 16G must better than 8G Bought this fire for my wife to replace one which got accidently broken.great My grandson really enjoyed this product. Good deal. The table is great just to experience what is available on a tablet without a hugh expense. I would recommend to others. Works great used to put the lights on when I was in Texas during the holidays. Bought this for a Christmas gift, so haven\\'t actually seen this in action yet. Checked other reviews and they were good, and Best Buy had an awesome Black Friday price. I purchased the kindle light because I love to read and needed something that would not die quickly. I also needed something smaller and lighter that could go anywhere with me. I love my purchase and a must have for all book worms. It works well for me, however, my wife seems to have cold fingers, and the touch screen does not always respond. One other odd quirk. If the tablet is turned off, and you plug it in to charge it, it automatically turns on. You then have to wait until it boots, and then turn it off again. This is very annoying. Before recommending to someone, I would tell them about this annoying quirk. I am really enjoying this device, I wanted something to use for entertainment purposes when camping. Something small yet powerful and this works perfect. 5 stars if your a prime member like me that way you can take advantage of the many thing prime has to offer yet still have available almost every other digital services out there. Would and have recommended this product. We got this for our three year old daughter. At first she was not interested it it at all she just wanted my tablet but once she got use to it she now prefers it to my iPad We bought this for our toddlers, and so far seems to hold up well with them. Some quirky rules with Amazon and accounts with product, but overall good for what we need. was a great purchase. loved the color and the camera feature My whole family loves Alexa. We have the dots in all the bedrooms. I love the smart home features you can add. I love the music offered as a prime member. And when you‚Äôre bored at home she will play games with you or even read you a book Finally decided to try Alexa. Lights, heating, doors, etc... everything is homekit compatible in my house. But this one was too tempting! What a great device. Alexa is years ahead of Siri, great system to have by your bed, and it also controls most of my devices... The Echo show screen is great, it is helpful with recipes, music etc. I use it to listen to music all the time. I am hoping someone in my family gets one soon so we can face time each other. my 7\" wore out,my 8\" is much better,allthough the covers are expensive and screen protectors are hard to find. the battery life is exceptional ! I have had this for several weeks. It works great. I am very satisfied with it so far. My daughter like her tablet it\\'s so simple to use. This Echo Show comes in handy. I use it almost as much as I thought I would. I am still learning all that it can do, but my favorite part is the screen. It‚Äôs not a huge deal, but if I could change one thing it would be a detachable power cable instead of hardwired. Easy hook up, great for lights and my Sony tv. I use all the time. Just lock the card out and let the kids go crazy!! Alexa in itself needs lots of improvement but with philips hue and smart plugs you can have a lot of fun settings I replaced an older tablet with this new version, all of my e-books transferred to the new one and I love it. My grandchildren are home schooled and utilize the tables for many learning apps! They LOVE using them as it makes them feel \"so grown up\"! The tablets are a great leaning tool and they are receiving many benefits from them! Video calls work great and the screen is super informative. Mom loves the tablet. Easy for her to use, she uses it for Facebook, reading, and some of her games. This tablet was a gift for my mother-in-law. She is technologically challenged and was able to set it up and use it with ease. Great multiuse tablet. The size is ok. Get the 8\" if you are like me and like a little more screamReal estate. I bought two of these as a birthday gift for my niece and nephew. They absolutely love them. They use it all the time to play games and music. Great deal, great price LOVE ITL:) This has been awesome. For my. 5 year old nephew. Keeps him entertained and it works great. I upgraded my Kindle to the Kindle Voyage because I read in bed and the lamp kept my husband awake. I thought I would be able to use this Kindle without the lamp, but for me it is hard to read with the room completely dark even though the back lighting is adjustable. I still use the Kindle with the lamp on, but tilted to the floor so that there is just a little light in the room....I bought the magnetic case so when I open the lid, the Kindle wakes up. It is a little smaller than my old Kindle and fits in my purse perfectly. All in All I LOVE it and would highly recommend it. Works great! Just the beginning of my plans for a smart house! Upgraded from my old Kindle keyboard. I love the ability to adjust brightness and font. I have small hands and this is not too big to hold in one hand. I was able to change the page turning buttons for left handed use. The charging cover last a long time. I wish there were more colors to choose from. Bought this for my 90+ year-old, totally no-tech mom. Her first e-book is Gone with the Wind. She likes the size and ease of use. Good picture, works well, great variety of apps. keep in mind that you get apps from amazon, not google play, so they aren\\'t always the same or same price I love the amazon fire kids edition. It has lots of fun apps for kids. We got this for my son for xmas. He loves it. He uses it daily. Great little tablet to take with you, great for kids this echo show lets you see so much, great item for your home! Easy to use tablet. Price is pretty good. My mom loves it. We bought this for our 2 yr old granddaughter and she loves it! It has so many apps and videos for her to watch. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is looking for a tablet for a child. Easy to set up and pair other compatible items by enabling skills through the Amazon app. I\\'ve been to best buy twice for information and how to questions and all seems to be going well. It\\'s only been a week and still have a lot to learn about Elexa\\'s capabilities This Alex\\'s device is fantastic and would recommend it for anyone. Especially for people with physical disabilities. We are enjoying all of its features. Got an unbelievable deal!! The best part is having a library of books at my fingertips!! Easy and simple to set up and great when I\\'m traveling!! The Kindle 8 is an inexpensive eReader that does what I need in the smallest, thinnest, lightest package. I want it for travel and portable convenience when a full-size tablet is too big and heavy. It\\'s perfect. I had been reading books on my iPad for years and finally broke down to get a kindle. It\\'s exactly what I hoped. The screen is easy to read in any light. It\\'s a light weight and size and easy to stow away in a small bag. Good products and service and happy with Amazon Fire Tablet I absolutely love my kindle 8! Great picture, storage & sound. Can\\'t live without my kindle! Very rugged design. My nieces absolutely love this. I love it!! It can do it all!! Beautiful color graphics and in no time at all, I can watch a movie or play games or read my favorite novel. I love it!! We finally decided to try the Echo system, after months and months of debate. We purchased the Echo Plus & an Echo Dot. The Plus easily handles our main two floors and the Dot handles our upstairs. The Plus\\'s speakers are incredible for its size. We both agree we made the right choice to get the Plus. Love the apps. His old fire stood up to significant wear/tear and drops. So I\\'m expecting the same with this one. 2 year warranty gives piece of mind. This was a purchase made for a cruise. I could not see my fire in the sun. Great electronic , very easy to install me and my family enjoy the things that Alexa do very satisfied with my service that I received from Best Buy when I purchase it looking forward to shopping there more often and I\\'m a new customer there Great tablet for reading and game play. Color is great. Very easy to set up. Adding other accessories that it operates is easy as well. Great product. Smartphone works on the job for me, but with the Fire I can read instructions and worksheets. It is a useful tool for connecting with both friends and colleagues. 8-inches is the right size for holding in hand and carrying with you. Gives me the information, beats printing everything out, or carrying around a large laptop. Great tablet! My son really likes it to read and also to play games! Love this tablet for streaming, facebook, games and general web surfing. The apps are available on the amazon underground, not google playstore, so some apps that you may be used to using, may not be available on amazon underground. Overall, great tablet for the price. Would recommend. I love it a lot and use it daily, bought books.... My 4 year old Grandson loves his Kindle. He had to have one after his sister got one. I have only been using my Amazon Echo Show for a couple days now but it works great. The microphone picks up my voice very easily, the sound quality is great, and it looks nice sitting on my coffee table! My nephew always uses my sister\\'s iphone when watching videos. He loves his youtube videos lol. So I went out and bought him this. The kid loves it. There\\'s value in the cartoon membership also We bought this and it‚Äôs a cool tool/toy to play with. We have it hook up to the lights and our appliances. We got these as an upgrade for the kids\\' Kindle Fires. Work great and have had no issues. This was a gift had no plan to purchase one. But very pleased with the portability and the sound quality I didn\\'t think I needed Alexa to have a screen, but now I\\'m so glad we got this. When I ask to see my grocery list, it pops up on the screen. Also can do video calls from it. Really like our Alexa and the dots...we have them in almost every room of the house now. First bought the Dot to see if we liked it. We enjoyed it, but wanted a little more volume. When I saw that the Show was much louder and had the camera we decided it was the right choice. Now we have the Dot in the bedroom and the Show in the living room. For larger rooms the Show is a great choice. This is my first tablet. So far, I am pleased with my Fire Tablet. I am not a gamer, I do basic internet searches and check e-mail. Is easier due to size, than using my smart phone. No problems or issues to this point. Great product will recommend it to friends and family. I got this tablet so I wouldn\\'t have to pack up my laptop when I went to my boyfriend\\'s when I want to do my online class. This is perfect for that The show has a good picture and good sound...love using it to look things up WISH the kindle fire (for kids) had better way to limit how many items you can download at once. Most kids do not understand that clicking on a bunch of pictures will download that game/program, which is CLOG download times. Needs a better way to remove unwanted items, rather than clicking.. and clicking on every item. Speed and performance is pretty good for a tablet. App store is great and has many items. Amazon - Echo Show is the best of all my Amazon products. I love the hands-free but able to see things on the screen. We already have the Echo in our house. I got this for my son for his apartment and he loves it. I love this tablet.It is very efficient and easy to use. I bought a kindle fire 2 years ago and enjoyed using it, I always wished for more storage and better connectivity. This new model has both and I can use with my amazon account. So far, so good. I\\'m quite pleased with the purchase. I had an early version of Kindle (pre-touch screen) and I didn\\'t anticipate that added feature would make that much difference but it is so nice. I still like hard copy books but reading on the Kindle Fire is quite enjoyable. I love all of my Amazon echo devices. Right now it doesn\\'t allow YouTube, but hopefully they will reach an agreement and fix that. I bought this for my Mom for Christmas and ended up she got me one too! Great for everyone, speaker sounds great easy to set up and my Mom ended up getting the dot so she could have her light turned on from downstairs and then tell Alexa to turn it off while in bed. No regrets on this one! This tablet was affordable and it\\'s pretty decent. Simple to use and setup for a 2 years old toddler. I bought this tablet to be pretty much exclusively an e-reader. It\\'s actually cheaper than most of the kindles. For that limited use, it works fine. I don\\'t think I would want to use it as a general purpose table (too slow!). Makes a fine e-reader though. As for recommending this to a friend, I would, but would make sure they knew what I use it for. Love this Kindle. There are to many apps and games offered for download. Love the book selection Easy to navigate The charger seems a bit loose, though Love it, take it with me everywhere, Not all of us are computer/technical savvy. Need better written, printable instructions on how to use. Step 1, step 2, etc. Its pretty good for the price, my only concern is the quality of the picture, not an hd one, my daughter complain when shes taking pics. good product for youngsters, provides learning and fun together I bought this tablet for my daughter who was turning 2 - but also because we were taking an 8 hour road trip and wanted her to be occupied. The games are very toddler user friendly and when she gets mad and throws it, it doesn\\'t effect the tablet. My only issue is that the charger doesn\\'t stay secure in the charger spot (sorry I don\\'t know the technical terms haha) so sometimes I will think it is charging and in fact it is not. I recommend buying the warranty for issues like that. I got this for myself on black Friday. I have had 2 Kindles before but never the Fire. Love it! A little more complicated than my original kindle, but I lIke it. Great Gift for anyone. Very easy to setup. Coexist with all IOT Devices. Alexa is AWESOME! I purchased 2 of these tablets for my 6 and 8 year old. They were a Black Friday special for $59. They are perfect for the apps and games they wanted. Like it so much I gave them out as gifts for Christmas I brought the Echo Plus for the louder sound quality. I already have an Echo Dot which I use in my bedroom to control my lights and heater via a Wemo Smart Switch. I brought the Echo Plus which I use in my family room for music and to control my smart devices. Love it! Really like the camera as my old one was backwards and hard to use. I love this and it\\'s great for kids got it for a early Christmas gift for a friends son and he loves it Very lightweight and portable with excellent battery life. My granddaughter loved her tablet and the color. It\\'s amazing how easy it is for her to use, perfect birthday gift I bought this tablet for my 10 year old grandson. He loves it! It is very easy to operate and has a great display. Great improved sound and built in smart hub is so useful. Works great, makes a great gift! ................. The Show is the new Alexa Device with a video screen. I like being able to see a screen when you ask questions, and you can view videos too. I also like that you can see the temperature, and date without having to ask. I like you can view a video of a recipe, not just see text. The one item missing from this great device is the capability to hook it up to your surround audio system.I have two dots and love them. The Show would be perfect if I could also hook it up to my audio system. Even though this feature does not exist, it still is a great product. Gave it to my grandkids(ages 3, 4 & 9) for Christmas and they loved it. Great for my 7 year old she loves it!!! Great price and great product!!! I thought that this tablet was junk but it has surpassed my expectations I had Microsoft Surface, unfortunately daughter dropped and cracked screen so needed a new tablet. Since went back to laptop for work didn\\'t need another Surface. Settled on 8\" Kindle HD over Samsung and IPad mini due to value. I only use for social networks, email, games, internet search, and occasional viewing of videos. This is a good basic tablet that can handle this no problem with a good wifi connection. Great value as I paid under $100 during the holidays and it has been as good as my Surface for these basic uses. Was looking for tablet to read books and this is perfect for that. Love this Kindle. There are to many apps and games offered for download. Love the book selection Easy to navigate The charger seems a bit loose, though The Echo Show is great but it is not just plug and play. The app directions are not understandable if you are having problems. However, the Amazon hot line was very helpful. But, who wants to have to call for help every week or two to keep things running. Alexa should be able to talk you through how to resolve her issues. All in all I am getting used to the features and like it. did not expect this kind of quality for the price I paid. very surprised. nice product. Had a great experience with my Best Buy rep! Great Job! This is a helpful addition to the home. It\\'s great to be able to set timers, play music, and check the news all hands free. The Echo Show is a version of Alexa with ability to visualize things. When I was cooking dinner and wanted to finish a show, I was able to ask Alexa to play the show from my Amazon Prime account. The Show was in my kitchen, easy to view, and enabled my kids to watch cartoons in the living room. I love it! Alexa runs my entire house. The Echo show is a great addition to the Echo family. Everyone needs one! Adds some nice tricks to the regular Echo lineup. Video calls to other Show owners works well. Speakers sound good. This was a present for my son, but he seems to be enjoying it, so it must be ok The store representative took his time with me to choose the right size and the lady at the check out got me hooked up with Best Buy Program membership. User friendly, hand free little assistant. Makes your mornings easier and gets you started for the day. And it looks cool My 5 year old sons love it , Seems to be well made . Good for Amazon music and news. Brilliant for controlling lights in the house. Great for small children allows for limited time setting. Also allows parents to set a requirement for how long educational apps must be used before free time. Case works well This Fire tablet is a nice upgrade to the one I purchased 3 years ago. The screen is great, it is very fast, has lots of storage with the SD card, and just an all-around good product. And a great value. This is a great little tablet for my son. It is easy for him to navigate through and it also has parental controls . I can control how long he uses it and what he reads. My 3yo is quite rough with stuff, as most are. And the case that comes with it is great!! Both my 2 year old and my 4 year old love this tablet! The best tablet for the price! All three of my children have one & they are worth it! It has great picture quality, all the applications seem to load very fast. we enjoy asking it questions about history & educational stuff for kids. Bought this for a work fundraiser and the recipient enjoyed it Nice deal, and good stuff. will recommend to others if same deal I love my Echo so much. I have my lights and front door deadbolt hooked up to it. I play music from it all the time and ask Alexa about the traffic and weather. I would recommend the Echo to everyone. My 6 and 4 year old boys love it and so do the parents Was a gift to replace older one and she really likes this one. Light and the battery last much longer. Bought this for my 4 yr. old for Christmas, she loves it and is very easy to use. The battery lasts a long time A little more complicated than my original kindle, but I lIke it. I bought several Alexa‚Äôs for Christmas gifts also for myself also bought Amazon Show for Christmas gift also for a my youngest Daugter ! Amazing product from Amazon within budget and get the best outcome of it bought for christmas present for son and family so we can communicate visually. Bought this for my teenage daughter and it works beautifully with great battery life. My mother has dementia and this keeps her busy for periods of time. She is fun to have around. I was initially going to just get the Amazon Kindle but I thought this gives me a tablet and a easy way to read books. I buy e-college texts. It has helped me so much!! I\\'m so happy I invested my money in this. I gave the Echo 5 stars but I like Amazon products and ultimately the product is good..however, I use Cree smart light bulbs in my house and bought this Echo for the built in Hub to try and eliminate the extra hub space in my house..but the built in hub of the Echo Plus isn‚Äôt compatible at this time with Cree light bulbs..so I had to return it and wait for now and stick with my regular Echo and Echo Dot‚Äôs. We got this mostly to read books and play some games it\\'s a cheap tablet so no problem if it gets broken don\\'t buy the extended warranty not worthy. It does everything amazon, and I can even see who is at the front door with Arlo! It doesn\\'t do Netflix, or Hulu, but that\\'s okay. I really like the sound, it fills small rooms. It\\'s easy now to video chat with Nana, or drop in to tell my kid\\'s goodnight, when I am working late. Serves my needs as required. Sound is good. Ability to move device where required is ideal It has been a lot of fun using in our kitchen. I think we use it much more than we thought we would. This is my second Amazon Fire. My first was the 7 inch and love the new 8 HD. Bought for my mom, shes in love with it. Use for netflix myself love the 8\\' great size and cpu speed. This is my 2nd tablet and it works great with downloading Bought for my eight year old. She absolutely loves it! Amazon\\'s Echo Show has been a great help to my daily rutine. From asking simple things like the weather to more specific things like flash briefings or traffic to my commute, echo show is a great tool for any tech enthusiast It was well worth the Black Friday price! The screen is so clear, it is easy to handle especially for people with not so big hands, easy and fast when navigating. Good tablet but no YouTube kids like on iPhone. Don\\'t expect iPhone/pad quality very basic AppStore for children We had the Echo (still do, it\\'s just in another room) and purchased the Show. We also have a couple of Dots and have them all set to communicate with each other. As you walk by the Show, it gives mini tips, news, fun facts, etc. Love it! You can even use it like Skype with others who have a show. Sound and response is good. Works well for area coverage. I purchased it so the weather and info can be seen on the screen. At the time I never knew there was an echo spot or I would have tried that. The show sounds good however I wish there was a ring or something on top that would light up like the original alexa. i needed something to read in the sunlight other than fire hd I was a little skeptical at first about the Amazon tap but after discovering how easy it was to set up, I was able to connect to my music library with ease! Great sound and nice to have the portability to take with me! Great tablet for the price. We have a tendency to go through multiple tablets a year with the little kids. This is a great price and does everything we want for our young kids. Amazon kindle products have always been reliable, consistent quality and this is no different. Very happy with it. I like having the screen and being able to see things like weather reports, etc. Still not using it to its full potential, but we have it controlling a couple of lamps, giving us weather reports, setting timers and alarms. It\\'s making me lazy! Sometimes it doesn\\'t hear my voice. Hears my husband\\'s voice better. I find it best to put it pretty close to me on a side table. Bought online for my granddaughter and she loves it, I have to get one for myself after seeing the quality of the picture, for the price this is a great works well the for the price display is hd love it I got this because it was a cheap tablet. It does great for watching videos from the tablet and sound is good also. I don\\'t like the amazon ecosystem or app store. I wish they would sell android tablets with their apps on them like they are doing with their phones. For under $100 this 8\" tablet is a bargain. I do all I want on it like; check email, Facebook, Twitter, watch YouTube, read books, and shop on eBay or Amazon. I\\'ve been very pleased with my purchase. I bought this low-priced Kindle to test as a travel replacement for my 14-pounds of laptop. I wound up taking it on a month-long trip out of the country, and it was superb for email, online transactions like buying theatre tix, and finding and making various reservations. Also, outstanding performance for videos and music. All this for $70. Suggest you buy a USB-mini cable if you buy one of these superb devices. yokod If reading is what you do the most with your tablet, this is good choice! I have been transforming my house to a smart home. So far thus is my favorite. Does so much I learn more each day I liked the screen size and easy to read books at night. The battery has a long life. The outer rcase could be stronger because concerned about durability. Only negative is the apps. Thought they were from android but they\\'re an Amazon version and limited. The ultimate lazy life is happening before my eyes. Now I love technology , always have . But let‚Äôs be honest , telling Alexa to turn the lights off and on and ask her to tell you a joke as examples . It really is great and I‚Äôm now addicted to the Hue line as well. I had to return my device due to WIFI signal dropping, maybe I just had a bad unit. I purchased two echo dots for Black Friday, once I loaded my XM I found the shortcomings. The volume was not load enough. Went back and picked this up and it filled up the room. The dot was moved to the bedroom were it was load enough for the small room. This speaker\\'s forte is it\\'s drop and charge ability. It does connect with no issues to whatever you have it paired with. The sound quality though is ok...Def not very loud and lacks the lows. But for a small portable speaker which is not expensive I would recommend it. Ok so in order to get three working well I needed to get four but the one that needed to be returned was quite easy. All is great! Kids love them! The parental control could be a lot better. It\\'s nice and compact. She loves it Was looking at some more expensive Android tablets to replace a 3-year old device and saw this one on sale. Despite the relatively much lower price, I was originally very worried that the Amazon app ecosystem was going to be sorely lacking compared to the full Google Play catalog. But it turns out that while it is missing some important apps (not just games but productivity apps too), the more than adequate specs (good enough screen, 1.5 GB of RAM, decent processor) are enough for 95% of what I need from a tablet. And if you can get it on sale, you can\\'t go wrong. Lastly, if you\\'re deciding between the 7\" and this 8\" Fire, splurge a little bit and get this one instead. I got this tablet for Skype calls and browsing. It\\'s good if you don\\'t have an ample scope of tasks Nice product I like the color of the screen very clear No complaints works great and the battery is awesome as always my son had a nabi we bought for learning & entertainment. there were many games we downloaded that didnt work without internet or would shut down randomly on it. But we habe yet to encounter a problem with the fire! i download games and books for him to read which work just great without having to be connected to the internet. Very impress with the echo show and all of its features Daughter uses it constantly for games, texting, Web surfing, and email. Great alternative to more expensive devices. Tablet good for kids and some adults. Price and screen resolution were also a selling point. The Kindle Fire is a wonderful, small device to use for a multitude of tasks. We use it mostly as an ereader and has been so simple to use. So happy we chose this one. It is lightweight and convenient to take with you. Overall I\\'ve been very happy with my new Kindle Voyage, the screen is much sharper than my wife\\'s paperwhite (v1) and the backlight is much more even. I\\'ve also been very happy with the page turn buttons. It makes it significantly more convenient to turn pages than using the screen and the pressure and feedback both seem about right. The only issue I have that keeps this from earning 5 stars is that the backlight on the screen has a slightly two-tone hue. It is somewhat yellowish on top and bluish on the bottom of the screen. It isn\\'t something that really distracts from reading but it is noticeable when looking for it. Fix this so the coloring is even and it is really a perfect ereader. I looked at Google Home .. And the Echo. I went with the Echo after I spoke to a Best Buy employee. They helped me sort out the pros and cons. I do love all the skills that are possible. Its like another person in my apt sometimes. (I live alone) the Echo adjusts my lights and plays my Pandora. I\\'m pretty much loving it. The whole family uses the ECHO we love the ability to use just say Alexa and tell here what we want. The youngest granddaughter loves the insult generator! This is so much easier to travel with than the lap top. I was against getting something in my house like this being skeptical about hackers watching thru the device. However, this is the greatest thing since sliced bread! It can do just about everything! And the sound is fantastic when steaming music! Being able to change the dish network channel by saying it is so convenient while hands are in the flour (for ex.)! Access to information is endless and immediate with her replies! We love it! This product is great and a nice addition to the echo family. This Amazon Echo is the COOLEST gadget you can buy, it is VERY SMART and learns very fast. it runs many items in our home IE Nest, LG TV, Lights I have both an Amazon Echo and Amazon Show and prefer the Show with the video screen. I use the Show to display recipes when cooking, lyrics to the music I‚Äôm listening to and video conferencing with my family. I like seeing headlines of stories scroll across the screen along with the t8me and temperature. Was recommended to me, and we love it, use for music, timer in the kitchen, great recipes, and love the question of the day, only have had for 2 weeks can‚Äôt wait to explore more! Great selections. Hard to find assistance at times. Works seamlessly and easy to set up and use. A great product. Not sure if this is due to the new version but I\\'m not able to install or even sideload certain apps onto the tablet. Amazon is really trying to lock out non-Amazon apps namely ones from Google. Aside from that though, performance is already and what you\\'d expect from a tablet in this price range. This was purchased for my mom and it does what\\'s needed and my mom has no complaints thus far. It is great , I like it very much. I can find anything you want. It‚Äôs fun for the family to play with, but it may get boring after the newness wears off. We‚Äôll see. I love the Kindle, it is a great product. It reduces eye strain so I enjoy reading on it. This is my second Kindle. I was looking for a blutooth speaker to use with my phone but I didn\\'t want to worry about things being ordered on my amazon account or the whole dreaded electronic eavsdropping that has been in the news the last few months. This speaker fits the bill as you can disable order by Alexa, and you have to manually push the listen button for the mic to pick up sound. The speaker quality is great for a portable option. The only thing that I don\\'t like is the charging stand can lose connection if its not sitting just right, but I can\\'t knock a star for this as they allow you to plug the cable directly into the unit itself which solves the problem. This is the second Amazon Fire 7 tablet I have purchased, this time in a color other than black. This, like the first, has met all my expectations. very satisfied with tablet, very fast and efficient'"

              "'was cheap, can not run chrome stuff, returned to store. Worthless, except as a regular echo and a poor excuse for video chat. I love my echo devices, bathroom, pool, kitchen, other places where I may need hands free, voice activated music and info. My wife bought me the \\'newest, hottest\\' thing. I was skeptical but then thought I would use it to help on a project. Me \"Alexa find videos on f450 drone\" Alexa \"YouTube is not available\". Amazon won\\'t directly sell chrome products, youtube won\\'t play on echo show. Further testing shows the video call is more limited than iPhone or Android apps for video. So the most useful thing now is the same voice functions that my echos and dots perform. Unless I want to make all of my video calls and check the weather from a device I can move no more than 3 feet from an outlet. Too bad Amazon turned this tablet into a big advertising tool. Many apps dont work and the camera is not good. I bought this Kindle for my 7 year old grand-daughter. I bought a warranty for it. I bought it in August, I have already had to replace it. The charger connection got loose and was not charging. Well, it has happened again. I will need to exchange it again. The problem is that I have to buy the warranty each time. I was going to buy one for her brothers and sister, but I am now rethinking that. I am reading positive reviews and wish I could say the same. Best Buy is great, so this is not a reflection on them, just our experience with the product. We have had this product for just over one month and I have had to contact Amazon Support, perform factory resets to get content to show up, and the device is poorly designed as the SD card pops out constantly, which messes with DRM, and does you no good if this happens when you are not connected to the Internet to fix it. We are returning, and spending the extra money for an iPad. Will not purchase another kindle device unfortunately just based on this experience. If you just use the device for reading, maybe this is for you, but trying to download information to SD card and actually being able to access it has been beyond frustrating, as well as having to do factory resets so content owned/ already purchased on Amazon would show up on the device in the library. I have to say it was a little confusing and frustrating when i was not getting the verification code from amazon , i waited for 20 minutes then i requested another code, nothing... then a nother one... and still nothing , i started to set up the device at 8.30 am and by 11.20 am i was fed up with it.. i had to step away.... after about 5 hours we went shopping and at the mall i recieved about 4 codes from amazon .... It\\'s a good device for children because they don\\'t know any better the speaker voice quality is terrible compare the similar size my logitech UE BOOM.the price is too high, even I got on promotion with $79 Needs to be a stand alone device. I should have not required to use a tablet of Cell phone to make it work. Amazon needs to work on the technology on device. Has a very good Bluetooth speakers sound quality is good but otherwise she\\'s pretty useless when it comes to get answering questions My first tablet was a Kindle. I was curious about the updated version. Very disappointed Would not take a charge, good thing i tried before wrapping it for Christmas. Looking at the picture and seeing it was 8th generation I assumed it would be a great device. I had an original Kindle but I stopped using it because it wasn\\'t backlit. I thought an 8th generation would be backlit and the picture makes it look backlit but it is not. After 25 minutes on the phone with Amazon trying to make it brighter the technician finally realized that 8th generation is not supported with backlights. I took it back to Target and purchased The Paperwhite which was more money but definitely worth it. The 8th generation one is smaller so I assumed that was the reason for the price difference. Target made the experience pleasant. I brought this tablet during the Black Friday sale fast forward to Christmas when my 6 year opens it he was happy I set it up for him two days later it crashed never came back on. Blank screen. He was disappointed and so was I . Not a very responsive program. Very limited information program. Not user friendly. For the price, you should be able to use as a speaker when talking on the phone. I had to use my daughter\\'s Beats Pill for this function, therefore it\\'s not worth all the hype. The last 2 models of Kindle HDX 8 have been terrible. We have purchased 2 of each model of Kindle and up until the last 2 models, they have been great. Last years had to be replaced 7 or 8 times and for the same problem. The slot for the SD card is defective. I gave up and bought the newest model. It shuts completely down if you try to plug it in to external speakers and sometimes it shuts down for no reason. It\\'s going back after the first of the year. This is going to be my last year for Kindles unless they make them the same quality as before. Phooey! Can\\'t really give a full review since the Kindle Fire seemed to work properly, however, the security, Webroot Anywhere, that was included was impossible to install. I tried calling Geek Squad 4 times for support and was disconnected EVERY time. I finally went to store for instructions which they printed off but still would not download. I\\'ve ended up buying an iPad which is fantastic and would not buy again from BestBuy. I I thought the buy For my child bc the kids mode but it was very poor Not sure will be keeping this. Worried about hacks that allow active mic. I bought a Kindle Fire 16GB for my 6 year old son in June. After 4 months the charging port came loose and the device will not charge. Best Buy is aware of the issue and will do nothing about it. Amazon will not warranty their product for more than 90 days and they said the charging ports often break if children are using them! They have no options to fix the device and only offer a small discount if I buy a new one. Amazon does not stand behind this product. They are aware of the defect and continue to sell these. did not power up...at all. I am so happy that my grand-niece wasn\\'t here and doesn\\'t know about this yet, she would have been crying. This is not like other android tablets in a bad way. Less than useless Does not work with Amazon CloudCam. I purchased this from Best Buy to allow me to monitor my two Cloud Cams from my kitchen. I am VERY tech savvy and have numerous Alexa devices but have been unable to get it to work. I tried installing and enabling the Amazon CloudCam Skill, made sure there were no new updates for the Show (the Show automatically updated when I first plugged it in). The final straw was when the tech support rep told me you can‚Äôt use the Show with the CloudCam‚Äîand then was unable to connect me with someone who could actually solve the problem. Useless is no help; less than useless actually makes more work. The Echo Show is less than useless. Bought this mostly as a backup.and to read a few books, since I have a larger cell phone and a back up. Used it occasionally may 40 or 50 hours of use till this week when I sent my laptop in for repairs. so I probably used it a tot this week. I was watching my 3rd Primetime video this week and it simply turned off. It will not turn on using any power trick such as safe mode. It is gone, It is toast. Bought it October 11, 2016 , It quit on February 9, 2015. My old Fire lasted 4 or 5 years with more use. it had stereo speakers, lasted a week on a charge not 2 or 3 days.Sturdier built. This is full of junk, I am not just offered more apps, it is constantly trying to add them. JUNK JUNK JUNK Not a good product short battery life i can only use for 20 minutes The reviews on this on Amazon seemed awesome. Little did I know that there is a chronic problem with the port on these tablets. We just bought this for Christmas and went to charge it for the first time. Nothing. We already loaded (and paid for) several apps, and now we\\'re out that money. Also the charging cord that came with it appears it has been used before - there\\'s some wear at the edge of it. So I went online to see if I could find this issue and there it is - everywhere. This is a problem that has been around for years, but Android - who is the ultimate culprit, has failed to fix it at the source. When you plug in the charger, there\\'s no \\'click\\' so you know it\\'s in place. It just slides in and out. We\\'ve had Apple products for several years and never had an issue, then the first Droid product we purchase can\\'t even be charged from the beginning. This will be going back to BestBuy - and will buy another iPad Mini - costs more, but is much much more reliable. I bought this product 4 months back. It is very slow, i can\\'t open any app in 15 seconds. OS is different than others so we can\\'t get normal apps easily. Only one thing i can say is slow slow slow performance. I don\\'t know how to replace it. Need some help from best buy people.I don\\'t know whether i got defective piece or this is the actual performance Not a very responsive program. Very limited information program. Not user friendly. This is fun but would not buy again. Not very informative. Keeps say \"I do not understand your question. \" I am disappointed that this is not more toddler friendly. It is a kindle inside a kid proof case. You have to set up child locks, etc. My biggest complaint is most of the games that are available you have to be connected to the internet. I wanted something to take to church, in the car, etc. This does not give great answers and the connection is not that great. Exchanging for a GOOGLE Home Bought this mostly as a backup.and to read a few books, since I have a larger cell phone and a back up. Used it occasionally may 40 or 50 hours of use till this week when I sent my laptop in for repairs. so I probably used it a tot this week.

This is full of junk, I am not just offered more apps, it is constantly trying to add them. JUNK JUNK JUNK Too proprietary, the apps my daughter liked I could not install on it for her so basically it was worthless for me and I returned it. The tablet itself works fine but this is the 2nd one I have gotten with a similar problem. The port seems to come defected. The charger doesn\\'t stay in and it takes a long time to charge. Replaced charger with a brand new one and it still has issues. I didn\\'t find it useful for my 4yr old daugter so i returned it the other day.All the games in it r so kiddy games. My first tablet was a Kindle. I was curious about the updated version. Very disappointed This is just a regular fire tablet that has protective case. 1st kindle screen failed & had to reboot often. Customer Service couldn\\'t fix. Replaced. 2nd one screen reboots often. Customer service offered replace. Just want one that works. Can\\'t get upgrade replacement Hard to use, Lots of ads, and Randomly closes apps I\\'m thinking this must of been a fluke, it never worked. Had to return item but received full refund The last 2 models of Kindle HDX 8 have been terrible. We have purchased 2 of each model of Kindle and up until the last 2 models, they have been great.

Too proprietary, the apps my daughter liked I could not install on it for her so basically it was worthless for me and I returned it. qc is really bad on this product and does not catch the voice properly. Purchased for my Father In Law - this was the most frustrating experience. Not user friendly - not friendly at all. Stick with a name brand tablet - Apple, Samsung, etc.. Avoid this device at all costs. The touch and loading the content is very bad, it doesn\\'t respond quickly and it very slow Returned product cause I did not like it and really had no use for it Hi,I ordered this for my daughter who has an extensive liking of tablets. She didnt like it because of lack of google play services and she didnt have the patience to work with it. I knew that the os is only amazon specific but despite the apps that can be downloaded, she was disappointed. I returned it.If you are an avid amazon person, the tablet works great, if you want a google tablet, this isn\\'t for you. I would recommend these for people that want a good decent tablet that they can read and use amazon apps on. Hard to use, Lots of ads, and Randomly closes apps HUB is almost useless. Ended up using spare Philips HUB. The HUB built in would only \"discover\" 2 out of 12 bulbs. 3 days of trying. HUE bridge 12 out of 12 first try. Loved my husbands 4th generation disappointed in my 5th generation. 4th generation has 2 speakers and sound is much louder than the current 5th generation. I purchased this expecting the same quality in sound, or better, since I use the kindle to watch my TV shows. Very cheap and was not impressed at all never again My Kindle Voyage is nearly 16 months old and worked perfectly. I kept receiving emails from Amazon about the software update. I switched off airplane mode, switched on wifi and shortly after the screen locked up. I have tried everything with customer support and they now tell me I will have to buy a new one. I am very annoyed. If I had left the software as it was my Kindle Voyage would still be working. I really like the echo plus and the hue light bulb does work on the echo plus but I had to buy a bridge from Phillips in order to schedule on off schedule times for the light. I thought the Echo Plus was like a bridge but I guess it isn‚Äôt. This Kindle is so overloaded with apps that I will never use. Despite what one of Best Buys\\' associates said, you cannot remove any of the Amazon apps. The apps take up too much of the memory. I have an I Pad and love but bought this as a backup for work. Unfortunately, it bogs down. I also don\\'t like that Amazon wants access to too much info to set up email, so I won\\'t use this for emails either. I will likely sell it on Craig\\'s List for less than half of what I paid for it. Difficult to purchase. No stock in 6 stores, no order online or ship to store available. When it did become available it did not work. Once it turned on, I couldn\\'t get any further. I could not log onto wifi network, though other items in my household work. Also the product wouldnt move past setting up the clock. Tried 3 days, gave up and returned the item. I do not like this Tablet one bit. It has to be registered with Amazon for it to function and it failed every time. I finally had to resort to calling Amazon\\'s customer service, also not an easy task, to get it registered. There seems to be glitch in the programming, because when it failed again, I had to follow the same steps all over again to get it registered. I would highly recommend skipping this tablet and getting one that is not tied to any one company\\'s operations, programming, or software. My 5 year old dropped this from a standing position (about a foot off the ground) and it busted. I had to use the BB warranty to replace it the day after purchase for a fall that the tablet should\\'ve been able to handle that is designed for kids. I\\'m happy with the apps, but definitely not thrilled with the lack of protection that is designed for kids. My first tablet was a Kindle. I was curious about the updated version. Very disappointed Prior to using the device I decided to recharge it to 100% and was shocked to find out that it takes 6 hours. Unless you have a lot of time don\\'t buy this device. This is not an upgrade by any means! My three year old kindle outperformed Oasis.Battery life better than a week with the lights on lowest setting Magnetic connector is poorly designed and grows weak Two pieces to keep up with; unsnaps constantly Amazon Customer Services promises it will resolved in an update Loved my husbands 4th generation disappointed in my 5th generation. 4th generation has 2 speakers and sound is much louder than the current 5th generation. I purchased this expecting the same quality in sound, or better, since I use the kindle to watch my TV shows. it would not load my books proper. took a dozen tries erasing an dreregistering. screen too dark I bought these as a gift for my adult kids to video chat while in college. The second best feature was YouTube. Amazon just sell google home and chromcast for goodness sakes! I do not like this Tablet one bit. It has to be registered with Amazon for it to function and it failed every time. I finally had to resort to calling Amazon\\'s customer service, also not an easy task, to get it registered. There seems to be glitch in the programming, because when it failed again, I had to follow the same steps all over again to get it registered. I would highly recommend skipping this tablet and getting one that is not tied to any one company\\'s operations, programming, or software. Cumbersome, complicated and not kid friendly..... went with Apple, suggesting you do too. it would not load my books proper. took a dozen tries erasing an dreregistering. screen too dark horrible...just like the other 7 i have owned ONLY due to warranties The screen is too dark, and cannot adjust the brightness Bought this mostly as a backup.and to read a few books, since I have a larger cell phone and a back up. Used it occasionally may 40 or 50 hours of use till this week when I sent my laptop in for repairs. so I probably used it a tot this week.

This is full of junk, I am not just offered more apps, it is constantly trying to add them. JUNK JUNK JUNK I think I downloaded 6 new apps. I wait to surf the web. This thing is so slow to respond. My old refurbished iPad is better. I really only bought it to stream Hulu and Netflix. I\\'m not excited about lighting up the home screen to find advertisements every day, but I guess you get what you pay for. I wanted inexpensive, I got it! Don\\'t buy this if you are used to using quick responding electronics. So slow returning mine for something different any suggestions just okay! Product was for my girlfriend. Doesn\\'t appear she uses it much except to steam music. Most of the questions I ask it I get nothing. I like Siri better. I have to say it was a little confusing and frustrating when i was not getting the verification code from amazon , i waited for 20 minutes then i requested another code, nothing... then a nother one... and still nothing , i started to set up the device at 8.30 am and by 11.20 am i was fed up with it.. i had to step away.... after about 5 hours we went shopping and at the mall i recieved about 4 codes from amazon .... I was looking for a kindle whitepaper. I saw online for $80. What a deal. I ordered it on line and picked it up in the store. I got it home and couldn\\'t adjust the brightness. After a lengthy time with online customer service I called customer service. After 20 minuets with speaking to a female Elmer Fud that doesn\\'t speak english well I figured I would just return it. Although it looks Identical to the $120 model, you can not adjust the brightness. That would have been good information before I bought it. She could perform some tasks ,but most things she didn\\'t know. So agrivating. I bought this tablet for my son and I don\\'t like it. The touch screen is very poor quality. It\\'s hard to move things around on it when he is playing a game. He prefers my iPad than to use his own. I know the iPad quality is probably the best quality but it\\'s way under that! Very frustrating. Will be returning it. The last 2 models of Kindle HDX 8 have been terrible. We have purchased 2 of each model of Kindle and up until the last 2 models, they have been great. Last years had to be replaced 7 or 8 times and for the same problem. The slot for the SD card is defective. I gave up and bought the newest model.

This is going to be my last year for Kindles unless they make them the same quality as before. Phooey! The protector was not made for the Fire 7 as it was to large and had no directions that were coherent. Worse purchase from Best Buy ever. I bought 2 of the Amazon Fire tablets because the sales guy said that they were great and ran really fast. I have very fast internet and this thing just barely chugs along. If you play a game, it constantly stalls and freezes. The sound quality when I play music is terrible. I was planning on buying one for each of my 9 nieces and nephews if they ran well but now I know that wouldn\\'t work for them because they are horrible. Purchased this device at launch (2 pack for $384.xx) and now YouTube doesn\\'t work. YouTube was one of the main features that I used. Without YouTube you\\'ll be better off buying the $40 Echo Dot instead. I habe the echo and I bought this one fort my son\\'s room but it\\'s not as user friendly. I wish I would\\'ve just bought the other one. Super slow, not of decent quality.I would not buy another. Memory on it is lacking for 8 gig. I will not recommend it to anyone I can\\'t update Facebook and a few other apps. It\\'s not what I expected. Less than useless Does not work with Amazon CloudCam. I purchased this from Best Buy to allow me to monitor my two Cloud Cams from my kitchen. I am VERY tech savvy and have numerous Alexa devices but have been unable to get it to work. I tried installing and enabling the Amazon CloudCam Skill, made sure there were no new updates for the Show (the Show automatically updated when I first plugged it in). The final straw was when the tech support rep told me you can‚Äôt use the Show with the CloudCam‚Äîand then was unable to connect me with someone who could actually solve the problem. Useless is no help; less than useless actually makes more work. The Echo Show is less than useless. Worst product ever. Constantly screwing up and filled with ads you have to pay to remove. Best Buy refused to help when I wanted to return it It was a bit more involved getting set up but thereafter the function is simply talking to Alexia. The plug adapter to turn on and off lights TV is useful and certainly worth having. I bought this because I have ebooks in college. Not only could I not get my ebook. I called the school IT department. They could not either. My semester was already started. The sales representative at the store told me this is what I needed. I ended up buying a tablet from my phone carrier and my ebooks were right there in less than 5 minutes with the schools IT department help. Too proprietary, the apps my daughter liked I could not install on it for her so basically it was worthless for me and I returned it. This tablet could be so much better if the apps actually worked decently. The built in Amazon pieces for Prime members is great and work flawlessly. But it\\'s not enough to overcome the terrible app behavior and countless freezes.  They need to take a lesson or two from Apple. Waste of money, ask Alexa a question and you are lucky if you get an answer instead of I\\'m not sure. The tap is a great concept, I love my echo so a portable one was that much better. However the sound is pretty terrible, no bass and can be scratchy.. It was a good concept just poor execution. After owning the kids Samsung, this seems confusing to navigate. Also they have returned to using the Samaumg'"
